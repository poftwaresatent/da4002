<h1>ITADS Exercise 1b: Java refresher (generics and inheritance)</h1>

<p>
These exercises will make you (re-)acquainted with some features of
object oriented programming that are extensively used in the rest of
the course. You can find help in chapter 4 of the course book and in
the online documentation, particularly about
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/index.html">generics</a> and
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/index.html">interfaces and inheritance</a>.
</p>

Create a directory for these exercises so that you can collect the files
in one place, and start a text editor.

<h2>exercise 1.12: polymorphism</h2>

<p>

Download <a href="/r/itads/exercise1b/PersonDemo.java">PersonDemo.java</a>,
which is part of the material distributed with the course book. It
defines several classes which form a simple hierarchy (<tt>Person</tt>, <tt>Student</tt>,
<tt>Employee</tt>) and a test program in the form of
<tt>PersonDemo</tt>. Compiling this file produces <tt>.class</tt> files for each of these classes.
</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    Consider the method <tt>printAll</tt> in
    class <tt>PersonDemo</tt>. What is the type of <tt>arr[i]</tt> in
    the <tt>for</tt>-loop?
  </li>
  <li>

    The statement <tt>System.out.print( "[" + i + "] " + arr[ i ]
    );</tt> implicitelly calls the method <tt>toString()</tt> for
    <tt>arr[i]</tt>. Can you explain the output of the program? Look
    at the definition of <tt>toString</tt> in all involved
    classes. Why is the output different
    for <tt>arr[0]</tt>, <tt>arr[1]</tt> and <tt>arr[3]</tt> if they
    all have the same type?
  </li>

  <li>
    Read in the book about <i>Dynamic Dispatch</i> (section 4.9, pages 146-149). Then redefine the method <tt>toString</tt> in class
    <tt>Student</tt> so that it only includes the name of the student
    in the result (note: you cannot use <tt>super.toString()</tt>).
  </li>
  <li>

    Define a new class for <tt>GraduateStudent</tt>: a kind of student
    that has also a field describing the subject they have majored
    in. Model this as a subclass of student with one more field of
    type <tt>String</tt> and define an adequate <tt>toString</tt>
    method.  Test your extension by adding a graduate student to the
    array in main.
  </li>
</ul>



<h2>exercise 1.13: using generics</h2>

<p>
<a href="/r/itads/exercise1b/Max.java">Max.java</a> implements two
generic methods for determining the maximum of two values.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Add a <tt>main</tt> method and test <tt>max</tt> with two strings given as command line arguments.
  </li>

  <li>
    Java's <tt>String</tt> class implements <tt>Comparable</tt> to
    compare strings according to the ordinary lexicographical order.
    If we want to compare strings according to their lengths, but
    without changing the implementation of <tt>String</tt>, we can
    define a custom <tt>Comparator</tt> and pass it to the second form
    of <tt>max</tt>. Try it out: define a class that implements the
    interface <tt>java.util.Comparator &lt; String &gt; </tt> to
    compare strings according to their length. Modify your main so
    that you can test this with command line arguments.
  </li>

  <li>
    <em>(optional)</em><br/>
    Define a generic method for finding the largest element in an
    array. Test your method with an array of strings read from the command
    line.
  </li>
</ul>



<h2>exercise 1.14 <em>(optional)</em>: defining generics (exercise 4.27 from the book)</h2>

<p>
Write a generic class called <tt>SingleBuffer</tt> which can store a
single item and supports three methods:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <tt>empty</tt>
  </dt>
  <dd>

    Returns <tt>boolean</tt> indicating whether the buffer is empty.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>
    <tt>get</tt>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Returns an item and empties the buffer. <tt>get</tt> can only be applied to a non-empty buffer.
  </dd>

  
  <dt>
    <tt>put</tt>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Stores an item. <tt>put</tt> can only be applied to an empty buffer.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
Test your implementation of <tt>SingleBuffer</tt> with different types
of items: <tt>int</tt>, <tt>String</tt>, and the <tt>Person</tt> class
from exercise 1.12.
</p>

<h2>exercise 1.15: introduction to Java's <em>collections framework</em></h2>

<p>
The library of algorithms and data structures provided by Java is known
as the <i>collections framework</i> (data structures are used to
collect data).  This library relies heavily on generics, and it will
repeatedly appear throughout the course.
</p>

<p>
All collection classes support <em>iteration</em>: a principled way of
going through all the elements stored in the collection. This is
achieved with code which looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
  for (<i>Type x</i> : <i>someCollection</i>) {
    <i>do something with x</i>

  }
</pre>

<p>
Try this out with two classes from the collection framework,
namely <tt>HashSet</tt> and <tt>TreeSet</tt>. To use them you can
declare variables of those types, such as:
</p>

<pre>
  java.util.HashSet &lt; String &gt; thisSet = new java.util.HashSet &lt; String &gt;();
  java.util.TreeSet &lt; String &gt; thatSet = new java.util.TreeSet &lt; String &gt;();

</pre>

<p>
Write a program which stores the command line strings in
a <tt>HashSet</tt> and in a <tt>TreeSet</tt> (hint: use
the <tt>add</tt> method) and then echoes each command string to
standard output. Use adequate for loops! Also, look up the online
documentation for the classes <tt>HashSet</tt> and <tt>TreeSet</tt>

and explain the difference in how the elements are output.
</p>

<h2>exercise 1.16: counting words</h2>

<p>
In this exercise we will use some data structures without worrying
about their implementation. This gives us an end-user perspective on
the things we will learn later.
</p>

<p>
Write a program that counts the number of <b>different words</b>
occurring in a text, based on the half-finished implementation in
<a href="/r/itads/exercise1b/CountWords.java">CountWords.java</a>.
Whenever this program inspects a word, it needs to determine whether
it has already been counted, so we need to store the words that have
already occurred in some data structure. In this case,
the <tt>java.util.Set</tt> class is just what we need:

</p>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <tt>public interface Set &lt; E &gt;  extends Collection</tt>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A collection that contains no duplicate elements. More formally, sets
    contain no pair of elements e1 and e2 such that e1.equals(e2), and at
    most one null element. As implied by its name, this interface models
    the mathematical set abstraction.
  </dd>

  <dd>
    Relevant methods in this interface are
    <pre>
      boolean add(E o)
      boolean contains(E o)
      int size()
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
There are two classes that implement this interface in the Java library.
</p>

<dl>

  <dt>
    <tt>java.util.HashSet &lt; E &gt;</tt>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The hash set has <i>very efficient</i> implementations of the
    operations, but it does not support ordered retrieval of elements.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <tt>java.util.TreeSet &lt; E &gt;</tt>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The tree set operations are less efficient, but the elements are
    retrieved in order.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>

The provided
half-finished <a href="/r/itads/exercise1b/CountWords.java">CountWords.java</a>
just counts the <em>total</em> number of words in a text that is read
line by line.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Test the half-finished <tt>CountWords</tt> like this:
    <p class="command">

      java CountWords &lt; CountWords.java
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Modify the program to <em>also</em> count the number of <em>different</em> words in the text and output.
  </li>

  <li>
    Modify the program to output the different words in the text, one word per line, in alphabetical order.
  </li>
</ul>
