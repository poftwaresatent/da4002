<h1>ITADS Exercise 3a: Sorting Algorithms</h1>

<p>
  As before, it is recommended that you create a new directory for
  this exercise, and also that you use
  a <a href="itads/exercise3/Makefile">Makefile</a> to manage the
  building of executables. (Unless you are using Eclipse, which does
  not need <tt>make</tt> but uses its own internal tool instead.)
</p>



<h2>exercise 3.5: bubble sort</h2>

<p>
  Read the Wikipedia article
  on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort">Bubble
  Sort</a>, one of the simplest sorting algorithms. Focus on section 2
  (implementation) but also consider parts of section 1 to understand
  the general idea behind the algorithm.
</p>

<p>
  Design and implement a <tt>BubbleSort</tt> class which sorts arrays
  of strings into alphabetical order. Write a <tt>main</tt> function
  which tests your implementation with the help of
  the <tt>createRandomStrings</tt> function
  from <a href="itads/exercise3/Factory.java">Factory.java</a>.
</p>



<h2>exercise 3.6: comparing insertion, merge, and bubble sort</h2>

<p>
  Download <a href="itads/exercise3/InsertionSort.java">InsertionSort.java</a> and
  <a href="itads/exercise3/MergeSort.java">MergeSort.java</a> files,
  which implement the sorting algorithms presented during lecture 3. Also download
