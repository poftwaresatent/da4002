<h1>ITADS Exercise 6: Graphs</h1>


<h2>exercise 6.1: shortest path examples</h2>

<p>
  For the graph shown in the figure below, perform the following tasks with pen and paper:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>

    Find the shortest unweighted path from V<sub>3</sub> to all other vertices.
  </li>
  <li>
    Find the shortest weighted path from V<sub>2</sub> to all other vertices.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>exercise 6.2: adjacency list with internal data</h2>

<p>
  The source archive <a href="/r/itads/exercise6/exercise6.tar.bz2">exercise6.tar.bz2</a> <em>(also available as <a href="/r/itads/exercise6/exercise6.zip">exercise6.zip</a> for Windows users)</em> contains a basic graph implementation.
  It is based on the adjacency list principle and stores "payload" data directly in the edges and vertices.
  The class <tt>RoadMap</tt> is an example application which contains a rudimentary file parsing method, too.

</p>

<ol>

  <li>
    Compile and run the application.
    Explain the output by looking at the file <tt>city-connections.txt</tt> which is used as input.
    Make a sketch of the graph to understand why there is no path from visby to goteborg, nor from ystad to ostersund.
  </li>

  <li>
    Extend the file parsing method <tt>RoadMap.load</tt> so that it optionally creates an undirected path.
    <em>The easiest way to achieve this is to insert, for each parsed edge, a duplicate edge going in the opposite direction.</em>

    Test the results of running <tt>RoadMap</tt> when the graph is interpreted in an undirected manner.
    Your output should now look something like this:
<pre>
loading undirected graph...
added edge ostersund <-> lulea
added edge ostersund <-> stockholm
added edge lulea <-> stockholm
added edge lulea <-> malmo
added edge goteborg <-> ostersund
added edge goteborg <-> ystad
added edge stockholm <-> goteborg
added edge stockholm <-> malmo
added edge stockholm <-> ystad
added edge stockholm <-> visby
added edge malmo <-> visby
added edge visby <-> ystad

loading directed graph...
added edge ostersund --> lulea
added edge ostersund --> stockholm
added edge lulea --> stockholm
added edge lulea --> malmo
added edge goteborg --> ostersund
added edge goteborg --> ystad
added edge stockholm --> goteborg
added edge stockholm --> malmo
added edge stockholm --> ystad
added edge stockholm --> visby
added edge malmo --> visby
added edge visby --> ystad

trying visby -> goteborg in undirected road map
  0: visby
  1: ystad
  2: stockholm
  3: malmo
  4: lulea
  5: ostersund
  6: goteborg
yes, there is a path from visby to goteborg

trying visby -> goteborg in directed road map
  0: visby
  1: ystad
no, there is no path from visby to goteborg

trying new_york -> goteborg in undirected road map
source city not found: new_york

trying goteborg -> bangkok in directed road map
destination city not found: bangkok

trying ystad -> ostersund in undirected road map
  0: ystad
  1: visby
  2: malmo
  3: stockholm
  4: goteborg
  5: ostersund
yes, there is a path from ystad to ostersund

trying ystad -> ostersund in directed road map
  0: ystad
no, there is no path from ystad to ostersund

</pre>
  </li>

  <li>
    Implement breadth-first search (BFS) and use that instead of depth-first search (DFS) for finding paths between cities.
    You can start by reading the <tt>Graph.dfs</tt> method, then copying and adapting it for BFS.
    Re-run the directed and undirected examples:
   In what way does the traversal order change?
  </li>

  <li>
    Add edge costs to the <tt>Edge</tt> class and change the <tt>RoadMap.load</tt> function to read them.
    Use the provided file <tt>city-connections-with-costs.txt</tt> to load the graph now.
    Print the edge costs while you parse the file.
    You will also need to extend the exception handling of the <tt>load</tt> method in order to deal with number format errors.
  </li>

  <li>
    Add a field to <tt>Vertex</tt> which allows to store the accumulated path costs.
    Modify the BFS and DFS methods to compute the cumulative path cost for each vertex as it gets encountered.
    Print this accumulated cost in the <tt>FindCity.visit</tt> method.
    Re-run the directed and undirected examples:
    Are the costs computed by DFS and BFS the same?
    Why?
  </li>

  <li>
    Add a field to <tt>Vertex</tt> which allows to trace back the path from the destination to the source, if such a path exists.
    You will have to modify the DFS and BFS methods again.
    Modify the <tt>RoadMap</tt> application to print the sequence of vertices whenever a path is found to exist.
  </li>

</ol>
