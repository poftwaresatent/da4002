      <h1>ITADS Exercise 3<br>
	structs and vectors</h1>
      
      <h2>Exercise 3.1: structs</h2>
      
      <p>
	The <a href="ex3/interval.c"><tt>interval.c</tt></a> source file contains a sketch of what an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic">interval arithmetic</a> package might contain in C.
	There is a type called <tt>Interval</tt> which stores a lower and an upper bound, and functions to <tt>create</tt>, <tt>add</tt>, and <tt>print</tt> intervals.
	When you compile and run this program, it simply prints two intervals and their sum.
      </p>
      
      <ol>
	<li
	   >Change the <tt>Interval</tt> declaration so that it stores the bounds in <tt>double</tt> format instead of integers.
	  Make sure to change all the other functions and variables accordingly.
	  <em>Reminder</em>: a good way to catch potential errors is to use the "<tt>-Wall</tt>" option of gcc, so the <tt>Makefile</tt> entry should look like this:
<pre class="code">gcc -Wall -o interval interval.c</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
	  None of the functions currently verify that <tt>low &lt;= high</tt> but this is a fundamental property required of intervals.
	  Write a <tt>normalize</tt> function which takes an interval and, if necessary, modifies it in-place such that it respects that property.
	  This means that you have to add the following function definition to your source file (place it after the <tt>create</tt>function):
<pre class="code">void normalize (Interval * ii)
{
  /* function body to be filled in by you.
      1. check if ii-&gt;low is bigger than ii-&gt;high
      2. if that is true, then swap ii-&gt;low with ii-&gt;high
          HINT: you need a temporary variable */
}</pre>
	  Notice that we <b>pass a pointer</b> to the <tt>normalize</tt> function.
          That function should swap <tt>ii-&gt;low</tt> with <tt>ii-&gt;high</tt> if they are in the wrong order.
          <b>Check your implementation</b> by changing the initialization of <tt>aa</tt> to "<tt>aa = create(3,&nbsp;2)</tt>" and then immediately normalizing it.
          In other words, the creation and normalization of <tt>aa</tt> will take two lines in the <tt>main</tt> function, like this:
<pre class="code">aa = create (3, 2);
normalize ( /* the address of aa */ );</pre>
          In the above, you have to replace "<tt>/* the address of aa */</tt>" with the C language construct that actually gets the address of <tt>aa</tt>.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Change the initialization of <tt>bb</tt> to "<tt>bb = create(50,&nbsp;-10)</tt>" <em>but do <b>not</b> call <tt>normalize</tt> on it</em>.
	  This should produce an erroneous result in the additon (try it out).
	  Now make the <tt>add</tt> function robust to non-normalized inputs, by adding two calls to <tt>normalize</tt>as the first two lines in its implementation, like this:
<pre class="code">Interval add (Interval lhs, Interval rhs)
{
  normalize (&amp;lhs);
  normalize (&amp;rhs);
  /* ... the rest of the add function remains the same */
}</pre>
          Verify that you get the correct answer again.
          However, as can be seen by the program output, <tt>bb</tt> will remain non-normalized.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <b>(Optional)</b> Modify the <tt>add</tt> function so that the effects of normalization remain after it has returned.
	  But make sure that your improved <tt>add</tt> function has no adverse side effects, such as changing the value of an outside variable (apart from the desired normalization)!
	  Hint: you will need to pass pointers instead of values for <tt>lhs</tt> and <tt>rhs</tt>, but that's only half the story.
	  Again, check your results by running the program, this time paying particular attention also to the printed values of <tt>aa</tt> (should be <tt>[2,&nbsp;3]</tt>) and <tt>bb</tt> (should be <tt>[-10,&nbsp;50]</tt>).
	</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Exercise 3.2: vectors</h2>
      
      <p>
	The source file <a href="ex3/vector.c"><tt>vector.c</tt></a> is a partial implementation of a dynamic array.
	It closely follows the example presented in lecture 2.
	There are several functions that still need to be filled in, but the source already provides an application that is ready to run.
      </p>
      
      <ol>
	<li>
	  Compile and run the <tt>vector</tt> program.
	  Notice that it performs a series of checks, called <em>unit tests</em>, which allow to quickly determine whether an implementation is complete.
	  Study the <tt>vector_append</tt> function (starting on line 89 of <tt>vector.c</tt>) and make sure you understand what it does by matching it with the relevant part of the messages printed by the <tt>vector</tt> program.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Fill in the function <tt>vector_prepend</tt> (starting on line 127 of <tt>vector.c</tt>).
	  It is probably easiest to start by studying what <tt>vector_append</tt> does, and following the same general implementation pattern.
	  Verify that your implementation is correct by running the <tt>vector</tt> program and analysing the output produced by the <tt>test_prepend</tt> function.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Fill in the function <tt>vector_insert</tt> (starting on line 153 of <tt>vector.c</tt>).
	  You can get inspiration from the <tt>vector_prepend</tt> function that you just implemented.
	  Again, verify that your implementation is correct by analysing the unit test output produced by running the <tt>vector</tt> program.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Fill in the <tt>vector_remove</tt> function (starting on line 183 of <tt>vector.c</tt>).
	  By now you should have the hang of this kind of test-driven implementation, using repeated runs of the unit tests to find out when you're done.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <b>(Optional)</b> The <tt>vector_grow</tt> utility function can be improved by using <tt>realloc</tt> instead of <tt>malloc</tt>.
	  Read the <tt>realloc(3)</tt> manual page (either by typing "<tt>man realloc</tt>" into the terminal or looking at the <a href="http://www.linuxmanpages.com/man3/realloc.3.php">online version</a>) to find out how it works.
	  Then, modify the <tt>vector_grow</tt> code to take advantage of it (you won't need <tt>memcpy</tt> anymore).
	</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Exercise 3.3 (optional): a vector-based stack</h2>
      
      <p>
	The source file <a href="ex3/stack.c"><tt>stack.c</tt></a> is a partial implementation of a program that prints the lines of a given file in reverse order.
	The idea is simple: push all the lines onto a stack, then pop and print until the stack is empty.
	Three of the required stack operations have not been implemented yet, but the source code contains instructions and hints.
      </p>
      
      <ol>
	<li>Implement the function <tt>stack_grow</tt> (line 74).</li>
	<li>Implement the function <tt>stack_push</tt> (line 98).</li>
	<li>Implement the function <tt>stack_pop</tt> (line 121).</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
	Test your implementation by passing the name of a text file, for example the source code itself, to the program.
      </p>
