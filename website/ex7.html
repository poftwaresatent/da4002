      <h2>Exercise 7.2: data visualization with Gnuplot</h2>
      
      <p>
	For empirical complexity analysis, we measure the time it takes to run certain algorithms on certain input data.
	A graphical plot of the measured data is an important tool for such an analysis.
	We will use the <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">Gnuplot</a> program to do this, as it can be used interactively as well as in batch mode (driven by a script file) and is installed on the UNIX workstations.
	The basic approach is to output the relevant data from our program in a line oriented format, save the output to a file using <em>redirection</em> (you can also copy-paste from the Eclipse output window into a text file), and commanding Gnuplot to visualize the data via an interactive terminal session.
	In this preparatory exercise, we will not plot actual running times but data created artificially.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	<em>
	  For further information, the Gnuplot homepage is a good source, for example it has <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/help.html">tutorials</a>.
	  It also has a manual page which can be access by typing "man gnuplot" in a terminal, or browsed <a href="http://linuxmanpages.com/man1/gnuplot.1.php">online</a>.
	</em>
      </p>
      
      <ol>
	<li>
	  <b>Produce empirical data:</b><br>
	  Create a program called <tt>gnuplot-intro</tt> that runs the following piece of code:
<pre class="code">long nn, ii, jj, s1, s2, s3;

for (nn = 100; nn < 5000; nn += 100) {
  s1 = 0;
  s2 = 0;
  s3 = 0;
  for (ii = 0; ii < nn; ++ii) {
    ++s1;
    for (jj = 0; jj < nn; ++jj) {
	++s2;
    }
    for (jj = 1; jj <= nn; jj *= 2) {
	++s3;
    }
  }
  printf ("%ld  %ld  %ld  %ld\n", nn, s1, s2, s3);
}</pre>
	  It should produce 4 columns of numbers as output, beginning with
<pre class="output">100  100  10000  700</pre>
          and ending with
<pre class="output">4900  4900  24010000  63700</pre>
        </li>
	<li>
	  <b>Store empirical data:</b><br>
	  Save the output in a file called <tt>data</tt>.
	  For example, you can copy-paste it from the Eclipse output window (but this will quickly become cumbersome if you need to frequently modify and re-run the program).
	  A more efficient method is to open a terminal, change directory to your workspace where the executable is placed by Eclipse, and run it with the following <em>output redirection</em>:
<pre class="command">cd path/to/your/worksapce/for/ex7
./gnuplot-intro | tee data</pre>
          This will display the data as well as save it into a file called <tt>data</tt>.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <b>Start Gnuplot:</b><br>
	  Open another terminal and also change to the workspace directory (or wherever you saved the <tt>data</tt> file) and launch gnuplot:
<pre class="command">cd path/to/your/worksapce/for/ex7
gnuplot</pre>
          The prompt in that terminal should change to
<pre class="output">gnuplot> </pre>
          In the following, this terminal window will be called the "Gnuplot terminal" or simply "Gnuplot" when it is clear that the currently running Gnuplot session is meant.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <b>Plot command syntax:</b><br>
	  Enter the following command in the Gnuplot terminal:
<pre class="command">plot 'data' using 1:2 with lines title 'linear'</pre>
          This produces a graphical representation using the first and second column of the <tt>data</tt> file, with a plot style that draws lines between data points, and creates a curve label called "linear."
          Note the use of single quotes around the file name and the title string.
          Gnuplot allows most of the specifiers to be abbreviated: "using" becomes "u," "with lines" becomes "w l," and title becomes "t."
          So the following command will give the same results:
<pre class="command">plot 'data' u 1:2 w l t 'linear'</pre>
          Try it out!
        </li>
	<li>
	  <b>Multiple plots, custom data ranges:</b><br>
	  Similarly, you can plot the third or the fourth column against the first one.
	  Try it out with the following commands:
<pre class="command">plot 'data' u 1:3 w l t 'quadratic'</pre>
          and
<pre class="command">plot 'data' u 1:4 w l t 'N log N'</pre>
          Note that Gnuplot remembers the commands you entered earlier and allows you to edit them.
          Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate the command history, and the left and right arrow keys to move around the current command line.
          You can also create a plot with all three curves at once, by placing them all on one plot command line separated by commas:
<pre class="command">plot 'data' u 1:2 w l t 'linear', '' u 1:3 w l t 'quadratic', '' u 1:4 w l t 'N log N'</pre>
          Note that when you use the same data file several times, you can just write an empty file name string '' (two single quotes with nothing in between).
          Unfortunately, the plot produced with this last command is dominated by the quadratic curve, as it contains much bigger values than the other two.
          You need to manually control the range of values to plot, which works like this:
<pre class="command">set yrange [0:100000]</pre>
          Then you have to issue the plot command again (use the arrow keys).
          If for some reason you want to re-enable autoscaling for the plot range, the command to use is:
<pre class="command">set yrange [*:*]</pre>
          This is useful if you change the plot command or update the data file with new measurements.
          Be sure to re-enable autoscaling before the next exercise.
          <em>
	    Notice that the "wxt" terminal type under Linux allows to interactively zoom and reset the plot, among other things.
	    This should be the default terminal type on the workstation in room B231c.
	  </em>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <b>Applying functions to data points:</b><br>
	  In addition to plotting values directly from a data file, it is also possible to use those values in mathematical expressions that Gnuplot shall visualize.
	  This requires a slightly different syntax in the "using" directive:
	  instead of just plain numbers, the value of a certain column has to be preceded by a dollar sign $, and the entire expression needs to be enclosed in parentheses.
	  For example, to plot the difference between the linear and NlogN data, enter the following command:
<pre class="command">plot 'data' u 1:($4-$2) w l t 'lin - NlogN'</pre>
          More importantly for the purpose of empirical complexity analysis, we need to find out whether a given set of measurements corresponds to a theoretical complexity expression.
          For example, how well does the fourth column from the data file match the O(N log N) class?
          Here we can profit from the set of functions built into Gnuplot, for example you can write "log($1)" to get the (natural) logarithm of the value stored in the first column of the data file.
          Putting all of this together, we can create a plot that shows how well column four matches the theoretical complexity like this:
<pre class="command">plot 'data' u 1:($4/$1/log($1)) w l t 'T / (N log N')</pre>
          Notice that this plot oscillates from around 1.45 to approximately 1.57, which indicates a fairly good match (it goes neither to zero nor to infinity).
          What would be the value for a perfect theoretical match, by the way?
	</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>Exercise 7.3: theoretical and empirical complexity</h2>
      
      <p>
	In this exercise, you first estimate the Big-Oh complexity in theory, then implement a program that creates data for plotting and visual verification of your estimate.
	It relies on the plotting commands from the previous exercise.
	Again, instead of measuring real execution times, we just increment a <tt>sum</tt> variable to as placeholder for clock measurements.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	What is the Big-Oh complexity of each of the following code fragments?
	You should first find a theoretical formula, then plot the <tt>sum</tt> variable in function of problem size <tt>nn</tt> to verify the theory.
	Make sure to also produce a plot that clearly illustrates convergence to a non-zero constant when dividing the measured "time" by the complexity expression.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	<em>
	  Note that the code has been adjusted such that <tt>nn</tt> varying from 100 to 5000 or so is a good range, with increments of 100.
	  Also, read the comments about recursive functions after the following code block.
	</em>
      </p>
      
<pre class="code">/* fragment 1 */
sum = 0;
for (ii = 0; ii < nn; ++ii) {
  ++sum;
}
for (jj = 0; jj < nn; ++jj) {
  ++sum;
}

/* fragment 2 */
sum = 0;
for (ii = 0; ii < nn; ++ii) {
  for (jj = 0; jj < ii; ++jj) {
    ++sum;
  }
}

/* fragment 3 */
sum = 0;
for (ii = 0; ii < nn / 100; ++ii) {
  for (jj = 0; jj < nn * nn / 20000; ++jj) {
    for (kk = 0; kk < jj; ++kk) {
      ++sum;
    }
  }
}

/* fragment 4 */
sum = 0;
for (ii = 1; ii <= nn * nn * nn; ii *= 2) {
  ++sum;
}

/* fragment 5 */
sum = 0;
recursion_a (nn * 10000);

/* fragment 6 */
sum = 0;
for (ii = 1; ii <= nn / 100; ++ii) {
  recursion_b (ii);
}</pre>

      <p>
	Notice that the <tt>sum</tt> variable needs to be global in order to properly record the execution cound in the recursive functions.
	The two recursive functions are defined as follows:
      </p>

<pre class="code">void recursion_a (long nn)
{
  long ii;
  if (nn >= 2) {
    for (ii = 0; ii < nn; ++ii) {
      ++sum;
    }
    recursion_a (nn / 2);
  }
}

void recursion_b (long nn)
{
  long ii;
  if (nn > 1) {
    for (ii = 0; ii < nn; ++ii) {
      ++sum;
    }
    recursion_b (nn - 1);
  }
}
</pre>
