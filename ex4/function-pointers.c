/*
 * A function that looks weird at first, but does something quite
 * powerful: it receives an array of doubles, and applies a function
 * to each number in that array. However, the function which is
 * applied is not determined here, it is defined by the location where
 * we call apply_fct. This is achieved using a function pointer.
 *
 * Function pointers seem confusing at first, but they really are very
 * simple once you realize that a function is nothing else but an
 * address! In fact, when you make a function call, execution will
 * jump to that address, and then back again when the function
 * returns.
 *
 * The only thing that is strange about function pointers is the
 * syntax required to declare them:
 *  1. the return type, just like when declaring a function
 *  2. an opening parenthesis followed by a star
 *  3. the name under which this function pointer should be made available
 *  4. a closing parenthesis
 *  5. another opening perenthesis
 *  6. the argument list, but it is common to just list the types and omit the argument names
 *  7. a final closing parenthesis
 *
 * So, when we write "void (*fct)(double*)" (see the last argument
 * below) this gets interpreted as:
 *  - fct is a function pointer: it stores the address of a function
 *  - the function returns void (in other words: nothing)
 *  - the function takes a single double* as argument
 *
 * In the body of apply_fct, we can now use the string "fct" just like
 * a regular function call. But it can call any function that matches
 * the declaration. In this case, any function that takes a double*
 * and returns nothing. Which function gets called depends on what
 * gets passed as third argument into apply_fct (see the three
 * examples in the main function).
