\section*{Rules}

Aside from the obvious rules of conduct exams (e.g.\ no chatting):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{No computing devices} (laptops, phones, calculators, \emph{etc}).
\item
  \textbf{No books or printouts}.
\item
  \textbf{Allowed self-written notes}: two sheets of A4 paper (front and back).
\end{itemize}



\section*{General Guidelines}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Read carefully} and pace yourself.
  You can solve the problems in any order you want, but later problems may be easier to solve after you have answered the preceding questions.
\item
  \textbf{Write clearly} and draw clear diagrams.
  If you need to correct a mistake, then cleanly cross out the wrong answer and clearly indicate where the correction can be found.
\item
  \textbf{Indicate the question number} for each of your answers.
  If a question has sub-questions, indicate the sub-question number after the main question number, separated by a dot.
  For example, question 3 has 4 sub-questions, and their answers should be numbered 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4.
\end{itemize}

\question{4 points}

identifying algorithms by analysing pseudocode
\begin{itemize}
\item linear search
\item sort (e.g.\ bubble sort, keep it very simple)
\item tree traversal (e.g.\ in-order, nicely recursive)
\item bfs (needs queue, is a bit more complex)
\end{itemize}



\question{4 points}

match ds diagrams with java code (and maybe usage scenarios?)
\begin{itemize}
\item circular linked list (task scheduling?)
\item child/sibling tree (language parsing?)
\item adjacency matrix (air travel planning?)
\end{itemize}



\question{3 points}

manually run sequence alignment with two different cost tables, make them enumerate all alignments that have the same cost (make sure one of the examples has more than one minimum)



\question{6 points}

big-oh analysis of several iterative and recursive functions, or variations thereof:
\begin{itemize}
\item let them match program snippets with plots of (fake) runtime measurements
\item match relative runtime-changes with complexity classes
\item how big of a problem can be solved in X minutes for each of the algos, given that a problem of size N takes Y minutes?
\end{itemize}



\question{2 points}

someone uses binary search tree to speed up searches, and after writing to file and re-reading, everything gets slower. why, and how to avoid?
