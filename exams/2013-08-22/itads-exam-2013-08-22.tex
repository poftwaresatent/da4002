\section*{Rules}

Aside from the obvious rules of conduct exams (e.g.\ no chatting):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{No computing devices} (laptops, phones, calculators, \emph{etc}).
\item
  \textbf{No books or printouts} except for non-electronic dictionaries.
\item
  \textbf{Allowed hand-written notes}: two sheets of A4 paper (front and back).
\end{itemize}



\section*{General Guidelines}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Read carefully} and pace yourself.
  You can solve the problems in any order you want, but later problems may be easier to solve after you have answered the preceding questions.
\item
  \textbf{Write clearly} and draw clear diagrams.
  If you need to correct a mistake, then cleanly cross out the wrong answer and clearly indicate where the correction can be found.
\item
  \textbf{Indicate the question number} for each of your answers.
  If a question has sub-questions, indicate the sub-question number after the main question number, separated by a dot.
  For example, question 3 has 4 sub-questions, and their answers should be numbered 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4.
\end{itemize}

\question{6 points}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Draw an example diagram for each of the following data structure types:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    simply linked list
  \item
    doubly linked list
  \item
    binary tree
  \item
    directed acyclic graph
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  For each of the two following diagrams, explain why it is \textbf{not} a valid example of any of the above data structure types.

\question{6 points}

The following C code contains a tree data structure type declaration and three traversal functions.
Note that the \texttt{Fifo} data structure and the various \texttt{fifo\_} functions provide a first-in first-out queue whose implementation is not shown.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  For each of the functions, write down whether it does pre-order, post-order, in-order, or level-order traversal.
\item
  Given the example tree in the diagram below, write down for each function the sequence of characters that it prints out.
  Note that the non-labeled horizontal arrows are the \texttt{sbl} pointers, the non-labeled downward-pointing arrows are \texttt{cld} pointers, and \texttt{\textsc{null}}-pointers are not shown.
\end{enumerate}

\question{4 points}

\emph{Hint: there is a lookup table for powers of 2 at the bottom of the page.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  What is the runtime complexity of the following \texttt{algo\_a}?
  The \texttt{Item} structure implements a simply linked list element containing an integer \texttt{num}, and there are $N$ items in the list.
  
  \verbatimtabinput{q3-snip1.c}

\item
  What is the runtime complexity of the following \texttt{algo\_b}?
  Like before, it also receives a simply linked list with $N$ elements.
  
  \verbatimtabinput{q3-snip2.c}

\item
  An algorithm is known to have $N\log N$ runtime complexity.
  It has been measured to require 10 seconds on a problem of size 1024.
  How long can it be expected to run on a problem of size 4096?
  
\item
  Another algorithm is known to have exponential runtime complexity.
  It requires 1 second to solve a problem of size 2048.
  How big of a problem can be solved if we are willing to wait for 4096 seconds?
\end{enumerate}
