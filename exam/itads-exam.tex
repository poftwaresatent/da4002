\section*{Rules}

Aside from the obvious rules of conduct exams (e.g.\ no chatting):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{No computing devices} (laptops, phones, calculators, \emph{etc}).
\item
  \textbf{No books or printouts}.
\item
  \textbf{Allowed self-written notes}: two sheets of A4 paper (front and back).
\end{itemize}



\section*{General Guidelines}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Read carefully} and pace yourself.
  You can solve the problems in any order you want, but later problems may be easier to solve after you have answered the preceding questions.
\item
  \textbf{Write clearly} and draw clear diagrams.
  If you need to correct a mistake, then cleanly cross out the wrong answer and clearly indicate where the correction can be found.
\item
  If you use separate sheets for your answers, \textbf{indicate the question number} for each of your answers.
  If a question has sub-questions, indicate the sub-question number after the main question number, separated by a dot.
  For example, question 3 has 3 subquestions, and their answers should be numbered 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3.
\end{itemize}

\question\label{q:container-structures-a}

The following four figures show four examples of data structures.
They are labelled with the letters \textbf{(A)}, \textbf{(B)}, \textbf{(C)}, and \textbf{(D)}.
The table below them lists names of data structure types.
For each type listed in the table, determine whether it is represented by one of the figures.
If there is a figure for a given type, write the corresponding letter into the second column of the table.
Mark structure types which are not shown in any diagram with a big \textbf{X}.\\[\baselineskip]

\question
\label{q:container-structures-b}

In question~\ref{q:container-structures-a}, three of the types listed in the table are missing from figures.
Draw a diagram for each missing type.
Clearly indicate which diagram is for which container type.
Make each diagram as similar as possible to one of the figures from question~\ref{q:container-structures-a}.

\question
\label{q:container-implementations}

The following Java code implements two data structures called \texttt{ContainerOne} and \texttt{ContainerTwo}.
Answer the following questions.
You can write the answers as annotations on the source code, or on a separate sheet of paper if you need more space.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Which container types are implemented by \texttt{ContainerOne} and \texttt{ContainerTwo}?
  \emph{Hint: they both appear in question~\ref{q:container-structures-a}.}
\item
  Describe what the \texttt{insert} method does for each of the two container implementations.
\item
  In \texttt{ContainerOne}:
  what is the role of \texttt{ContainerOne.handle}, \texttt{Node.foo}, and \texttt{Node.bar}?
  Suggest better names for these three fields.
\item
  In \texttt{ContainerTwo}:
  what is the role of \texttt{ContainerTwo.alpha}, \texttt{ContainerTwo.beta}, \texttt{Node.foo}, and \texttt{Node.bar}?
  Suggest better names for these four fields.
\end{enumerate}
