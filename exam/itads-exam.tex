\section*{Rules}

Aside from the obvious rules of conduct exams (e.g.\ no chatting):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{No computing devices} (laptops, phones, calculators, \emph{etc}).
\item
  \textbf{No books or printouts}.
\item
  \textbf{Allowed self-written notes}: two sheets of A4 paper (front and back).
\end{itemize}



\section*{General Guidelines}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Read carefully} and pace yourself.
  You can solve the problems in any order you want, but later problems may be easier to solve after you have answered the preceding questions.
\item
  \textbf{Write clearly} and draw clear diagrams.
  If you need to correct a mistake, then cleanly cross out the wrong answer and clearly indicate where the correction can be found.
\item
  If you use separate sheets for your answers, \textbf{indicate the question number} for each of your answers.
  If a question has sub-questions, indicate the sub-question number after the main question number, separated by a dot.
  For example, question 3 has 3 subquestions, and their answers should be numbered 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3.
\end{itemize}

\question\label{q:container-structures-a}

The following four figures show four examples of data structures.
They are labelled with the letters \textbf{(A)}, \textbf{(B)}, \textbf{(C)}, and \textbf{(D)}.
The table below them lists names of data structure types.
For each type listed in the table, determine whether it is represented by one of the figures.
If there is a figure for a given type, write the corresponding letter into the second column of the table.
Mark structure types which are not shown in any diagram with a big \textbf{X}.\\[\baselineskip]

\question
\label{q:container-structures-b}

In question~\ref{q:container-structures-a}, three of the types listed in the table are missing from figures.
Draw a diagram for each missing type.
Clearly indicate which diagram is for which container type.
Make each diagram as similar as possible to one of the figures from question~\ref{q:container-structures-a}.

\question
\label{q:container-implementations}

The following Java code implements two data structures called \texttt{ContainerOne} and \texttt{ContainerTwo}.
Answer the following questions.
You can write the answers as annotations on the source code, or on a separate sheet of paper if you need more space.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Which container types are implemented by \texttt{ContainerOne} and \texttt{ContainerTwo}?
  \emph{Hint: they both appear in question~\ref{q:container-structures-a}.}
\item
  Describe what the \texttt{insert} method does for each of the two container implementations.
\item
  In \texttt{ContainerOne}:
  what is the role of \texttt{ContainerOne.handle}, \texttt{Node.foo}, and \texttt{Node.bar}?
  Suggest better names for these three fields.
\item
  In \texttt{ContainerTwo}:
  what is the role of \texttt{ContainerTwo.alpha}, \texttt{ContainerTwo.beta}, \texttt{Node.foo}, and \texttt{Node.bar}?
  Suggest better names for these four fields.

\question
\label{q:sorting-complexity}

A company sends their vice president for marketing (VPM) and their chief technology officer (CTO) to a big trade show.
Each of them collects business cards from the many people they meet.
Sitting down at the desks in their hotel rooms in the evening, each of them alphabetically sorts the received business cards.
However, they employ different strategies:

\begin{description}
\item[The VPM]
  proceeds as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    He places the pile of unsorted cards onto the desk to his right.
  \item
    He picks the top card from the unsorted pile and places it to his left.
  \item
    Then, he picks the next card from the unsorted pile, and places it either underneath or on top of the card on the left depending on whether the name on the new card comes before or after the name on the old card.
  \item
    He then repeatedly does the following, until the unsorted pile has vanished:
    he picks one card after another from the right, scans for its place in sorted pile, and inserts it there.
  \end{itemize}
\item[The CTO]
  does it differently:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    He divides the unsorted pile in two, with roughly the same amount of cards in each sub-pile, and places them side-by-side on the desk.
  \item
    He then repeatedly halves each unsorted sub-pile in the same manner, until he has a row of small unsorted piles, with approximately 5 cards in each of them.
  \item
    Then, he picks up each small pile in turn, sorts it in his hand by rearranging cards as needed, and places the sorted piles back on the desk.
  \item
    Now that he has many small sorted piles, he proceeds to merge pairs of them by picking cards either from the one or the other --- such that the alphabetical order is maintained --- and places them on a bigger pile.
  \item
    Each time he has built a bigger pile out of two small ones, he places the big pile onto the desk and merges the next pair of small piles.
    Whenever he runs out of small piles, he repeats the process with the big piles, merging them into even bigger piles, until he has only one pile left.
  \end{itemize}
\end{description}

Assume that it takes
0.4 seconds to compare two individual cards,
2 seconds to divide a pile into two halves,
3 seconds to sort 5 cards ``in hand,''
and 0.5 seconds to pick cards during the merging of two piles.
Assume that all other delays can be ignored.
Answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Develop a formula for $T_\text{VPM}(N)$ which allows to estimate the amount of time required by the VPM to sort $N$ business cards.
\item
  Give the \emph{Big-Oh} complexity for $T_\text{VPM}(N)$.
\item
  Develop a formula for $T_\text{CTO}(N)$ which allows to estimate the amount of time required by the CTO to sort $N$ business cards.
\item
  Give the \emph{Big-Oh} complexity for $T_\text{CTO}(N)$.
\item
  Who will take longer to sort small amounts of business cards ($N<20$ or so)?
  Who will take longer to sort large amounts of cards ($N>40$ or so)?
  Explain your answers!
\end{enumerate}
