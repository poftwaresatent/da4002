\section{Detecting container types in code}

In groups of two students (pairs of neighbors together), discuss and decide which type of container is implemented by \texttt{ContainerOne} and \texttt{ContainerTwo} in the provided source code.
Also discuss and decide on answers for the two related questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  In \texttt{ContainerOne}, what is the role of \texttt{ContainerOne.handle}, \texttt{Node.foo}, and \texttt{Node.bar}?
  Suggest better names for these attributes.
\item
  In \texttt{ContainerTwo}, what is the role of \texttt{ContainerTwo.alpha}, \texttt{ContainerTwo.beta}, \texttt{Node.foo}, and \texttt{Node.bar}?
  Again, suggest better names for these attributes.
\end{itemize}

\emph{
  This activity is based on question 3 of the written exam from October, 2011.
  Solutions are available on the course website.

\section{Estimating runtimes using Big-Oh}

The class is divided randomly into two groups.
Each group selects one of them to take notes for the common parts of the activity.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  \emph{Without solving} the specific questions, each group discusses and decides which of the formulas on slide 10 of lecture 5 can be used to solve to each of the 4 questions on the provided sheet of questions.
  Then discuss where and how to use the numeric tables at the bottom of the question sheet.
\item
  Each student solves the 4 questions individually, asking one of their group members for help if they get stuck.
\item
  Discuss in the group which part of the activity you found the most difficult, and why.
  As a group, write down one aspect that seems the most important, then share your impressions with the entire class.
\end{enumerate}

\emph{
  This activity is the same as exam question 4 from October, 2012.
  Solutions are available on the course website.

\section{When is Big-Oh useful?}

The class is again divided randomly into two groups.
And again, each group selects one of them to take notes.

Each group discusses the benefits and drawbacks of the Big-Oh approach to computational complexity.
What does it do, what does it assume, when is this good or bad, how much can be inferred from it?
At the end of the discussion each group decides what is for them the most important advantage, and what is the most important disadvantage.
This consensus is written down and then shared with the entire class.

\emph{
  There is no strict right or wrong in this activity.
  The purpose is for everyone to clarify why we learn about Big-Oh and when it can be useful in practice.
