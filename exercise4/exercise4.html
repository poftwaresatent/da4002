<h1>ITADS Exercise 4: Complexity Analysis, Data Plotting</h1>

<h2>preliminaries: summary and common errors</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    For nested loops, the total time is affected by the product of the loop sizes.
    For consecutive loops, it is not.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not just blindly count the number of loops.
    A pair of nested loops that each run from 1 to N<sup>2</sup> accounts for O(N<sup>4</sup>) time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the logarithm to describe the running time for a problem solved by halving the size in constant time.
    If it takes more than constant time to halve the problem, the logarithm does not apply (at least not directly).
  </li>
</ul>



<h2>exercise 4.1: comprehension test</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Programs <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> have worst-case running times no greater than <b><tt>T(N) = 150 N log N</tt></b> and <b><tt>T(N) = N<sup>2</sup></tt></b> respectively.
    Answer the following questions, <em>if possible</em>.
    If it is not possible to give an answer, explain why.
    <ol>
      <li>
	Which program has the better guarantee on the running time for large values of <tt>N</tt> (<tt>N</tt> &gt; 10000)?
      </li>
      <li>
	Which program has the better guarantee on the running time for small of <tt>N</tt> (<tt>N</tt> &lt; 100)?
      </li>
      <li>
	Which program will run faster <em>on average</em> for <tt>N</tt> = 1000?
      </li>
      <li>
	Can program <em>B</em> run faster than program <em>A</em> on <em>all</em> possible inputs?
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    An algorithm takes 0.5ms for input size 100.
    Assuming that low-order terms are negligible, how long will it take for input size 500 if the running time is
    <ol>
      <li>
	linear?
      </li>
      <li>
	O(N log N)?
      </li>
      <li>
	quadratic?
      </li>
      <li>
	exponential? <em>(this means O(2<sup>N</sup>))</em>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    An algorithm takes 0.5ms for input size 100.
    Assuming that low-order terms are negligible, how large a problem can be solved in 1 minute if the running time is
    <ol>
      <li>
	linear?
      </li>
      <li>
	O(N log N)?
      </li>
      <li>
	quadratic?
      </li>
      <li>
	exponential?
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>



<h2>exercise 4.2: measuring and plotting running times</h2>

<p>
  Start by downloading the "tarball" archive with all required files.
  It is available here: <a href="itads/exercise4/exercise4.tar.bz2">exercise4.tar.bz2</a>
  (<em>Windows users can download <a href="itads/exercise4/exercise4.zip">exercise4.zip</a> instead</em>).
  Save it at the top-level of the directory where you created all the other exercise directories.
  Then, in order to extract the files, use the following command:
</p>

<p class="command">
  tar xfvj exercise4.tar.bz2
</p>

<p>
  This will create a new directory called <tt>exercise4</tt>.
  Change into that directory, build its contents, and run the <tt>SortingComplexity</tt> application.
</p>

<p class="command">
  cd exercise4<br/>
  make<br/>
  java SortingComplexity
</p>

<p>
  This produces output very similar to what you have already seen in exercise 3b.
  The biggest change is that the running times are now also saved into a file called <tt>log.data</tt> and that the program gives suggestions for plotting the data using <a href="http://linuxmanpages.com/man1/gnuplot.1.php">gnuplot</a>.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Open a new terminal window, change into the <tt>exercise4</tt> directory, and start the <tt>gnuplot</tt> program.
    Then copy-paste the first two lines of the suggestions printed by <tt>SortingComplexity</tt> into the <tt>gnuplot</tt> terminal.
    (<em>Hint:</em> under Linux, copy-pasting is as simple as selecting the text by right-dragging the mouse over the text you want to copy, then middle-clicking into the terminal where you want to pase it.)
    This should create a figure which looks like the thumbnail shown here<br/>
    <a href="itads/exercise4/gnuplot-screenshot.png"><img src="itads/exercise4/gnuplot-screenshot-small.png" alt="screenshot of gnuplot for the insertion sort running time"/></a><br/>
    (Click on the thumbnail or <a href="itads/exercise4/gnuplot-screenshot.png">here</a> to see the full-scale version.)
  </li>
  <li>
    What is the Big-Oh complexity of insertion sort?
    Does the figure you just created match this?
    Check your answer by plotting the running time of insertion sort divided by the Big-Oh function.
    If you choose the right Big-Oh, that division will converge to a non-zero value.
    (<em>Note:</em> you can use some of the suggestions printed by the <tt>SortingComplexity</tt> application.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat the last exercise also for merge sort and bubble sort.
  </li>
</ol>



<h2>exercise 4.3: theoretical and empirical complexity</h2>

<p>
  In this exercise, you first estimate the Big-Oh complexity in theory, then implement a benchmark which logs running times for various problem sizes, and finally plot the data graphically to check whether your theoretical estimates are correct.
<p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Estimate the Big-Oh complexity of each of the following 9 code fragments:
<pre>
  // fragment 1
  for (int ii = 0; ii &lt; N; ++ii) {
    sum++;
  }
  
  // fragment 2
  for (int ii = 0; ii &lt; N; ii += 2) {
    sum++;
  }
  
  // fragment 3
  for (int ii = 0; ii &lt; N; ++ii) {
    for (int jj = 0; jj &lt; N; ++jj) {
      sum++;
    }
  }
  
  // fragment 4
  for (int ii = 0; ii &lt; N; ++ii) {
    sum++;
  }
  for (int jj = 0; jj &lt; N; ++jj) {
    sum++;
  }
  
  // fragment 5
  for (int ii = 0; ii &lt; N; ++ii) {
    for (int jj = 0; jj &lt; N * N; ++jj) {
      sum++;
    }
  }
  
  // fragment 6
  for (int ii = 0; ii &lt; N; ++ii) {
    for (int jj = 0; jj &lt; ii; ++jj) {
      sum++;
    }
  }

  // fragment 7
  for (int ii = 0; ii &lt; N; ++ii) {
    for (int jj = 0; jj &lt; N * N; ++jj) {
      for (int kk = 0; kk &lt; jj; ++kk) {
        sum++;
      }
    }
  }
  
  // fragment 8
  //   note: ii starts at 1, otherwise it would be an infinite loop
  for (int ii = 1; ii &lt; N; ii *= 2) {
    sum++;
  }
  
  // fragment 9
  //   note: ii and jj start at 1, and the kk loop is not always executed
  for (int ii = 1; ii &lt;= N; ++ii) {
    for (int jj = 1; jj &lt;= ii * ii; ++jj) {
      if (0 == jj % ii) {
        for (int kk = 0; kk &lt; jj; ++kk) {
          sum++;
        }
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Read the <tt>SortingComplexity.java</tt> source code in order to understand:
    <ul>
      <li>
	how the problem size is varied,
      </li>
      <li>
	how the running time is measured,
      </li>
      <li>
	and how the data log file is created.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Create a new application which measures and logs the running time of the 9 code fragments you analyzed above.
    You can start by copy-pasting the structure and logging code from <tt>SortingComplexity.java</tt>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use <tt>gnuplot</tt> to verify your theoretical analysis.
  </li>
</ol>
