<h1>ITADS Exercise 5a: Recursion, Divide and Conquer</h1>



<h2>exercise 5.1: various recursion exercises</h2>

<p>
  Download <a href="itads/exercise5/RecFunctions.java">RecFunctions.java</a> and fill-in the missing implementations.
  Please read the comments in each function to see what you have to do in each case!
  When you run the program the output should be as follows:
</p>

<p class="command">
  java RecFunctions<br/>
  55<br/>
  1155<br/>
  16<br/>
  1024.0<br/>
  true
</p>




<h2>exercise 5.2: printing numbers in any base</h2>

<p>
  Write a program that prints an integer in a given base.
  It should take two inputs from the command line: the integer to print, and the base to use.
  Some example output of your program should be:
</p>

<p class="command">
  java PrintNumber 42 2<br/>
  in base 2, the number 42 is written 101010<br/>
  <br/>
  java PrintNumber 17 16<br/>
  in base 16, the number 17 is written 11<br/>
  <br/>
  java PrintNumber 4002 3 <br/>
  in base 3, the number 4002 is written 12111020
</p>

    Hints:
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The course book uses this example to explain some basic recursions in chapter 7.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    Your program should check against invalid input, such as bases that are smaller than 2.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    Can you handle negative numbers?
    You don't need to go into variations of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">Two's Complement</a>, just prepend a "-" sign.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    If the base is bigger than 10, you should use characters from the alphabet to continue the series of digits.
    The Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> explains this in (much) more detail.

<h2>exercise 5.3: enumerate permutations using divide and conquer</h2>

<p>
  Write a program which writes all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation">permutations</a> of a given string.
  Some example output would be:
</p>

<p class="command">
  java Permute AB<br/>
  AB<br/>
  BA<br/>
  <br/>
  java Permute 123<br/>
  123<br/>
  132<br/>
  213<br/>
  231<br/>
  312<br/>
  321
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>
    Hints:
  </dt>
  <dd>
    You'll need a mixture of iteration and recursion.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    You can use <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuilder.html">StringBuilder</a> to build a string which omits just a certain character position from a given string.
    For example, to omit the 2nd character of "foo", you could write:
    <pre>
String foo = "foo";
StringBuilder bar = new StringBuilder();
for (int ii = 0; ii < foo.length(); ++ii) {
  if (1 != ii) {
    bar.append(foo.charAt(ii));
  }
}
String fo = bar.toString();
</pre>
