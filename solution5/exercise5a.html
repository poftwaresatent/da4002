<h1>ITADS Exercise 5a: Recursion, Divie and Conquer</h1>



<h2>exercise 5.1: printing numbers in any base</h2>

<p>
  Write a program that prints an integer in a given base.
  It should take two inputs from the command line: the integer to print, and the base to use.
  Some example output of your program should be:
</p>

<p class="command">
  java PrintNumber 42 2   
  in base 2, the number 42 is written 101010
  
  java PrintNumber 17 16
  in base 16, the number 17 is written 11
  
  java PrintNumber 4002 3 
  in base 3, the number 4002 is written 12111020
</p>

  <dd>
    The course book uses this example to explain some basic recursions in chapter 7.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    Your program should check against invalid input, such as bases that are smaller than 2.

    Can you handle negative numbers?
    You don't need to go into variations of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">Two's Complement</a>, just prepend a "-" sign.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    If the base is bigger than 10, you should use characters from the alphabet to continue the series of digits.
    The Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> explains this in (much) more detail.

<h2>exercise 5.2: enumerate permutations</h2>

<p>
  Write a program which writes all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation">permutations</a> of a given string.
  Some example output would be:
</p>

<p class="command">
  java Permute AB
  AB
  BA
  
  java Permute 123
  123
  132
  213
  231
  312
  321
</p>

    You can use <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuilder.html">StringBuilder</a> to build a string which omits just a certain character position from a given string.
    For example, to omit the 2nd character of "foo", you could write:
    <pre>
String foo = "foo";
StringBuilder bar = new StringBuilder();
for (int ii = 0; ii < foo.length(); ++ii) {
  if (1 != ii) {
    bar.append(foo.charAt(ii));
  }
}
String fo = bar.toString();
</pre>
