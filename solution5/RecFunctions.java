class RecFunctions{

    /*
      This class includes a number of functions that should be
      implemented recursively. It has the purpose of providing you
      with material for training your understanding of recursion. In
      many cases the best solution might not be recursive, but here
      you are asked to give a recursive method!

      Think of the rules from the book:
      
           Always at least one base case!
           The recursive calls should make progress towards the base case!
           Trust that the recursive call will do what is expected!
