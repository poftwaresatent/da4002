 * Insert an item into a tree. It returns the root which should be

 * the root that was given to the function). The way to call this
 * function is as follows:
 *
 *   root = intbst_ins (root, data);
 *
 * Where root is the root item of your binary search tree. Note that
 * passing root==NULL is valid, and indeed a convenient way to
 * initialize a tree with the first data item. This function does one
 * of four things:
 *
 *  1. If an empty slot has been found, create a new item for the
 *     data, to attach it as a new leaf to the tree.
 *
 *  2. If the given data is smaller than the one already stored in the
 *     root, then recurse into the left subtree for insertion there.
 *
 *  3. If the data is bigger than what we already have, recurse into
 *     the right subtree instead.
 *
 *  4. Otherwise, the data is already stored in the tree, so we do
 *     nothing.

/*
 * Remove an item from the tree. Similarly to intbst_ins, this
 * function returns a root to be used in place of the current one, and
 * is thus intended to be called like this:
 *
 *   root = intbst_rem (root, data);
 *
 * Where root is the root item of your binary search tree. In most
 * cases, the returned item will be just the root passed in as
 * argument. But if the given root matches the data and one or both of
 * its subtrees are NULL, then something else is returned.  This
 * function does one of the following:
 *
 *  1. If the data is smaller than what is stored in this root,
 *     recurse into the left subtree.
 *
 *  2. If the data is bigger, then recurse to the right.
 *
 *  3. If the data matches and this root is a leaf (has no children),
 *     then simply remove it. NOTE that this is handled transparently
 *     by the code which handles possibility #4.
 *
 *  4. If the data matches and this root has only one subtree (either
 *     left or right), then use the "parent re-attachment trick" to
 *     skip over us.
 *
 *  5. If none of the above can be used, then we find the smallest
 *     child of the right subtree, and replace this root with that
 *     smallest child. It would work just as well to use the biggest
 *     child of the left subtree.
