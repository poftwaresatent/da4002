#include <stdio.h>

/*
 * Syntax for pointers and arrays:
 * - &foo is the address where the variable foo is stored
 * - *ptr is the value stored at the address ptr
 * - arr[2] is the third element of an array called arr
 * - arr itself is nothing but a pointer to the first element
 *
 * We also use two more format specifiers, and another escape
 * sequence, for printf:
 * - %p prints an address in hexadecimal
 *      (this is used to show where pointers point)
 * - %s prints a string stored at a certain address.
 * - \" prints a quote character
 *      (actually, escape sequences are interpreted by the compiler,
 *      not printf)
 *
 * And we use the fact that the C compiler simply concatenates string
 * literals to split lines to print into separate lines in the
 * sourcecode, to make it more readable and reduce the number of calls
 * to printf.
