     the standard input/output library. The printf() function converts
     its arguments to the standard output stream (which is called
     stdout). The OS takes care of connecting stdout to the terminal
     where the application was launched, so whenever printf() is
     called there will be messages written on the terminal.
     
     In the most simple example, printf() takes a single string and
     writes it as-is to stdout. Note that the terminal needs to be
     specifically instructed when a new line should be opened, which
     is achieved by placing the special two-character code \n into the
     string. Such two-character codes that begin with a backslash are
     called escape-sequence, they are translated by the C-compiler
     into character codes that signify special commands for the
     terminal.
