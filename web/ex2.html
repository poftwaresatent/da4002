<h1>ITADS 2012 exercise 2:<br/>
<em>arrays, pointers, strings</em></h1>

<p>
<em>Hint: read the <a href="http://poftwaresatent.net/r/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=75&Itemid=84">Linux intro</a> if you forgot some details about developing C programs under Linux...</em>
</p>


<h2>exercise 2.1: arrays</h2>

<p>
The <tt>prime.c</tt> program shown below uses an array as a convenient
way to keep track of numbers that are not prime.
</p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define MAXNUM 100

int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
  char is_prime[MAXNUM - 1];
  int ii, num;
  
  for (ii = 0; ii < MAXNUM - 1; ++ii) {
    is_prime[ii] = 1;
  }
  
  for (num = 2; num <= MAXNUM / 2; ++num) {
    for (ii = num * 2 - 2; ii <= MAXNUM - 2; ii += num) {
      is_prime[ii] = 0;
    }
  }
  
  printf ("prime numbers up to %d:\n ", MAXNUM);
  for (ii = 0; ii < MAXNUM - 1; ++ii) {
    if (is_prime[ii]) {
      printf (" %d", ii + 2);
    }
  }
  printf ("\n");
  
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<ol>
  <li>
    Try to understand how it operates <em>(Hint: it is based on an
      ancient method of finding prime numbers)</em> and verify that it
      prints the correct result by compiling and running it. Can you
      explain why it sometimes adds or removes 1 or 2 to the indices
      and output?
  </li>
  <li>
    Modify the program to produce a histogram of the number of integer
    divisors except 1 and itself, for every number from 2 to 20. The
    output of the program should be:
    <pre class="command">
NUMBER OF INTEGER DIVISORS other than 1 or itself:
  2 
  3 
  4 *
  5 
  6 **
  7 
  8 **
  9 *
 10 **
 11 
 12 ****
 13 
 14 **
 15 **
 16 ***
 17 
 18 ****
 19 
 20 ****</pre>
  </li>
</ol>



<h2>exercise 2.2: a first look at pointers</h2>

<p>
The annotated source code <a href="itads2012/ex2/pointers-arrays-strings.c"><tt>pointers-arrays-strings.c</tt></a> reviews some of the explanations about pointers and arrays that were part of lecture 1.
Compile and run <tt>pointers-arrays-strings</tt> and make sure you understand how the output relates to the source code.
</p>



<h2>exercise 2.3: command line arguments</h2>

<p>
We have now covered enough basics to understand the two arguments of
the <tt>main</tt> function that is required for every C program: the
shell (which interprets the commands you type into the terminal) cuts
the command line into tokens that are separated by spaces, uses the
first token to find the program to run, and places all the tokens into
an <b>array of C strings</b>. The size of this array (i.e. the number
of arguments including the name of the program) gets passed
to <tt>main</tt> as its first argument, commonly named <tt>argc</tt>
(for "argument count"), and the pointer to the first element in this
array gets passed as the second argument to <tt>main</tt>, and that is
commonly called <tt>argv</tt> (for "argument vector"). The declaration
of <tt>argv</tt> can look weird at first, because it is a pointer to a
pointer (indicated by <b>two <tt>*</tt> characters</b>), but this is
explained by fact that <tt>argv</tt> is an array (which is
equivalent to a pointer), and the elements of that array are strings
(which is also equivalent to a pointer).
</p>

<p>
<b>Try it out</b> by creating the following simple program which
simply prints the contents of the argument array. It also introduces
the <tt>strlen</tt> function, which is useful in case you need to find
out the length of a string.
</p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
  int ii;
  for (ii = 0; ii < argc; ++ii) {
    size_t len = strlen (argv[ii]);
    printf ("argv[%d] (length %zu):\t`%s'\n", ii, len, argv[ii]);
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<ol>
  <li>
    Copy the above sourcecode into a file called <tt>printargs.c</tt>,
    compile it, and run it. It should produce the following output:
    <pre class="command">
argv[0] (length 11):    `./printargs'</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Run the <tt>printargs</tt> command with some simple parameters:
    <pre class="command">
./printargs some arguments   and some   spaces</pre>
    Explain the resulting output.
  </li>
  <li>
    Try some more complicated looking arguments:
    <pre class="command">
./printargs bravo \\ "" "something with spaces"</pre>
    This illustrates some possibilities for passing all kinds of
    strings as arguments into a C program.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type a command that produces the following output:
    <pre class="command">
argv[0] (length 11):    `./printargs'
argv[1] (length 1):     `&quot;'</pre>
  </li>
</ol>



<h2>exercise 2.4: strings are character arrays</h2>

<p>
Write a program called <tt>eascii</tt> that takes a string as command-line argument and prints a table with three lines:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>first line</dt>
  <dd>Each printable character between single quotes.</dd>
  <dd><em>Hint:</em> use the <a href="http://www.linuxmanpages.com/man3/isprint.3.php"><tt>isprint()</tt> function</a> from the <tt>ctype.h</tt> header.</dd>

  <dt>second line</dt>
  <dd>Each character's ASCII code in decimal</dd>

  <dt>third line</dt>
  <dd>Each character's ASCII code in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a></dd>
  <dd><em>Hint:</em> the <tt>pointers-arrays-strings.c</tt> code from exercise 2.2 contains explanations about printing values in hexadecimal.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
For example, the output of your program for "hello" should be:
</p>

<pre class="command">
 'h' 'e' 'l' 'l' 'o'
104 101 108 108 111
 68  65  6c  6c  6f</pre>



<h2>exercise 2.5: bubble sort</h2>

<p>
Sorting is one of the most fundamental tasks that programs have to
perform under all kinds of circumstances, and many algorithms have
been developed to sort various kinds of data under different
circumstances. A very simple example
is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort">Bubble Sort</a>
which is based on the idea of repeatedly scanning through the data,
and swapping any two neighboring items that are in the wrong
order. The following code shows how it works in principle, but this is
a quite inefficient implementation. <em>(This code also uses some
convenient C syntax for initializing and sizing static arrays, and a
way to <tt>printf</tt> floating point numbers with a given precision
as well as reserving space for the optionally leading minus
sign.)</em>
</p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
  int ii, jj, length;
  double data[] = { 351.354, 21.02, -3544.2, 152.999 };
  double tmp;
  
  length = sizeof(data) / sizeof(double);
  
  for (ii = 0; ii < length; ++ii) {
    for (jj = 1; jj < length; ++jj) {
      if (data[jj] < data[jj - 1]) {
	tmp = data[jj];
	data[jj] = data[jj - 1];
	data[jj - 1] = tmp;
      }
    }
  }
  
  for (ii = 0; ii < length; ++ii) {
    printf ("% 8.2f\n", data[ii]);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
Based on this example implementation of bubble-sort and what you've
learned above about command line arguments, write a program
called <tt>args-bubble-sort</tt> that takes each argument string and
sorts it character-by-character. The output of the program should be
for example (depending on the arguments that you give it):
</p>

<pre class="command">
./args-bubble-sort 743 oiufObIwUWBF

in:  743
out: 347

in:  oiufObIwUWBF
out: BFIOUWbfiouw</pre>
