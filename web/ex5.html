<h1>ITADS 2012 exercise 5<br/>recursion and trees</h1>



<h2>exercise 5.1: recursion</h2>

<p>
The source code <a href="itads2012/ex5/recursion.c">recursion.c</a> contains three different implementations of the <tt>power</tt> function, which computes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation">exponentiation</a> (for integer exponents only).
Each implementation does the same thing, but one of them prints detailed messages about what is going on.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Compile and run <tt>recursion</tt>.
    Read the program output side-by-side with the source code and make sure you understand what's going on:
    <ul>
      <li>
	The <tt>power_verbose</tt> function <em>calls itself</em> (with a modified argument)!
      </li>
      <li>
	That is called <em>recursion</em>, and it is a very useful programming technique.
      </li>
      <li>
	In this case, the recursion computes the power function for a smaller exponent.
	Then, we simply multiply that result with the base.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Download the partial code <a href="itads2012/ex5/factorial.c">factorial.c</a> and implement the <tt>factorial</tt> function such that it recursively computes the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial">factorial</a> of the given number.
    There are comments in the code which explain this in more detail.
    When you're finished, the output of the <tt>factorial</tt> program should be:
    <pre class="command">
 0! =       1
 1! =       1
 2! =       2
 3! =       6
 4! =      24
 5! =     120
 6! =     720
 7! =    5040
 8! =   40320
 9! =  362880
10! = 3628800</pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
The important thing to understand about recursion is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    There has to be a termination condition for which the result can be computed <em>without recursion</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Recursive functions call themselves, but with modified arguments.
  </li>
  <li>
    The sequence of argument modifications through the recursive calls must lead to a situation where the termination condition is fulfilled.
    Otherwise, an infinite recursion would result (which will crash your program).
  </li>
</ul>



<h2>exercise 5.2: child-sibling trees</h2>

<p>
The partial implementation of child-sibling trees in <a href="itads2012/ex5/cstree.c">cstree.c</a> is ready to run, but it is missing the function implementations for computing printing the items in the tree, as well the function for computing the depth of each item.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Implement the <tt>cstree_post_order</tt> function (line 111).
    With a correct implementation of the post-order traversal function, the program output should look like this:
    <pre class="command">
computing depth
*** Please implement cstree_compute_depth.
post-order traversal:
1
2
B
C
3
4
5
6
D
x
y
z
7
E
A
pre-order traversal:
*** Please implement cstree_pre_order.</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Implement the <tt>compute_depth</tt> function (line 142 in the original <tt>cstree.c</tt>).
    After that, the output of post-order traversal should be nicely indented, like this:
    <pre class="command">
initializing tree
computing depth
post-order traversal:
    1
    2
  B
  C
    3
    4
    5
    6
  D
      x
      y
      z
    7
  E
A
pre-order traversal:
*** Please implement cstree_pre_order.</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, implement <tt>cstree_pre_order</tt> (originally on line 157).
    Then, your output should look like this:
    <pre class="command">
initializing tree
computing depth
post-order traversal:
    1
    2
  B
  C
    3
    4
    5
    6
  D
      x
      y
      z
    7
  E
A
pre-order traversal:
A
  B
    1
    2
  C
  D
    3
    4
    5
    6
  E
    7
      x
      y
      z</pre>
  </li>
</ol>
