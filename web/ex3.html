<h1>ITADS 2012 exercise 3<br/>structs and vectors</h1>



<h2>exercise 3.x: vectors</h2>

<p>
The source file <a href="itads2012/ex3/vector.c"><tt>vector.c</tt></a> is a partial implementation of a dynamic array.
It closely follows the example presented in lecture 2 (<a href="itads2012/slides/02-vectors-and-lists-print.pdf">handout</a>).
There are several functions that still need to be filled in, but the source already provides an application that is ready to run.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Compile and run the <tt>vector</tt> program.
    Notice that it performs a series of checks, called <em>unit tests</em>, which allow to quickly determine whether an implementation is complete.
    Study the <tt>vector_append</tt> function (starting on line 89 of <tt>vector.c</tt>) and make sure you understand what it does by matching it with the relevant part of the messages printed by the <tt>vector</tt> program.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fill in the function <tt>vector_prepend</tt> (starting on line 127 of <tt>vector.c</tt>).
    It is probably easiest to start by studying what <tt>vector_append</tt> does, and following the same general implementation pattern.
    Verify that your implementation is correct by running the <tt>vector</tt> program and analysing the output produced by the <tt>test_prepend</tt> function.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fill in the function <tt>vector_insert</tt> (starting on line 153 of <tt>vector.c</tt>).
    You can get inspiration from the <tt>vector_prepend</tt> function that you just implemented.
    Again, verify that your implementation is correct by analysing the unit test output produced by running the <tt>vector</tt> program.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fill in the <tt>vector_remove</tt> function (starting on line 183 of <tt>vector.c</tt>).
    By now you should have the hang of this kind of test-driven implementation approach, using repeated runs of the unit tests to find out when you're done.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Optional (advanced)</em><br/>
    The <tt>vector_grow</tt> utility function can be improved by using <tt>realloc</tt> instead of <tt>malloc</tt>.
    Read the <tt>malloc(3)</tt> manual page, in particular the section describing <tt>realloc</tt>, and modify the <tt>vector_grow</tt> code to take advantage of it.
  </li>
</ol>
