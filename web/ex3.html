<h1><em>introduction</em></h1>

<p>
As programs grow more complex, it quickly becomes necessary to
organize them. One of the fundamental concepts to improve organization
is the <em>function</em> (also
called <em>subroutine</em>, <em>procedure</em>, or in object-oriented
languages the <em>method</em>). Another fundamental mechanism is to
organize information into <em>structures</em> (simply <tt>struct</tt>s
in C). In a sense, functions structure the computation, and structs
structure the data.
</p>

<p>
The first exercise session looks at functions and how they provide
parameterized computations. Furthermore, functions can be collected
in <em>libraries</em> for reuse in many applications. For example,
the <tt>printf</tt> function that we used in previous exercises is
provided by the standard input/output library <tt>stdio</tt>. And all
the applications we write in C are nothing but an implementation of a
function called <tt>main</tt>, which the operating system uses to know
where to start program execution.
</p>

<p>
The second exercise session introduces structs and how they can be
used to organize data. It is common to have connections between the
functions and structs for a given application. Frequently, functions
will apply to specific structs, an organizational principle that is
strongly reflected in object-oriented programming languages.  Although
C is not object-oriented, it is still possible (and rather frequent)
to use this organizational principle.

<h2>exercise 2.1: hello world, again</h2>

<p>
Like practically all programming languages, C makes it very easy to
create custom functions and use them in various contexts. All
functions start with a <em>declaration</em> that (i) gives a name to
the function, (ii) states what type of value it returns, and (iii)
lists the types of arguments it accepts. The <em>definition</em> of
the function provides the source code that implements the required
computations. In C, declaration and definition can be separate, which
is an important feature that we will use in later exercises and in the
projects, but for now we keep them together.
