<h1>ITADS 2012 exercise 3<br/>structs and vectors</h1>



<h2>exercise 3.1: structs</h2>

<p>
The <a href="itads2012/ex3/interval.c"><tt>interval.c</tt></a> source file contains a sketch of what an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic">interval arithmetic</a> package might contain in C.
There is a type called <tt>Interval</tt> which stores a lower and an upper bound, and functions to <tt>create</tt>, <tt>add</tt>, and <tt>print</tt> intervals.
When you compile and run this program, it simply prints two intervals and their sum.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Change the <tt>Interval</tt> declaration so that it stores the bounds in <tt>double</tt> format instead of integers.
    Make sure to change all the other functions and variables accordingly.
    A good way to catch potential errors is to use the "<tt>-Wall</tt>" option of gcc:
    <pre class="command">gcc -Wall -o interval interval.c</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    None of the functions currently verify that <tt>low &lt;= high</tt> but this is a fundamental property required of intervals.
    Write a <tt>normalize</tt> function which takes an interval and, if necessary, modifies it in-place such that it respects that property.<br/>
    <em><u>Hint</u>: you will need to pass a pointer to the <tt>normalize</tt> function.</em><br/>
    Check your implementation by changing the initialization of <tt>aa</tt> to "<tt>aa = create(3,&nbsp;2)</tt>" and then immediately normalizing it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Change the initialization of <tt>bb</tt> to "<tt>bb = create(50,&nbsp;-10)</tt>" <em>but do <b>not</b> call <tt>normalize</tt> on it</em>.
    This should produce an erroneous result in the additon (try it out: <tt>cc</tt> should now become the incorrect <tt>[52,&nbsp;-7]</tt> instead of the correct <tt>[-8,&nbsp;53]</tt>).
  </li>
  <li>
    Now make the <tt>add</tt> function robust to non-normalized inputs, by adding two calls to <tt>normalize</tt> as the first two lines in its implementation.
    Verify that you get the correct answer again.
    However, as can be seen by the program output, <tt>bb</tt> will remain non-normalized.
  </li>
  <li>
    Modify the <tt>add</tt> function so that the effects of normalization remain after it has returned.
    But make sure that your improved <tt>add</tt> function has no adverse side effects, such as changing the value of an outside variable (apart from the desired normalization)!<br/>
    <em><u>Hint</u>: you will need to pass pointers instead of values for <tt>lhs</tt> and <tt>rhs</tt>, but that's only half the story...</em><br/>
    Again, check your results by running the program, this time paying particular attention also to the printed values of <tt>aa</tt> (should be <tt>[2,&nbsp;3]</tt>) and <tt>bb</tt> (should be <tt>[-10,&nbsp;50]</tt>).
  </li>
</ol>



<h2>exercise 3.x: vectors</h2>

<p>
The source file <a href="itads2012/ex3/vector.c"><tt>vector.c</tt></a> is a partial implementation of a dynamic array.
It closely follows the example presented in lecture 2 (<a href="itads2012/slides/02-vectors-and-lists-print.pdf">handout</a>).
There are several functions that still need to be filled in, but the source already provides an application that is ready to run.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Compile and run the <tt>vector</tt> program.
    Notice that it performs a series of checks, called <em>unit tests</em>, which allow to quickly determine whether an implementation is complete.
    Study the <tt>vector_append</tt> function (starting on line 89 of <tt>vector.c</tt>) and make sure you understand what it does by matching it with the relevant part of the messages printed by the <tt>vector</tt> program.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fill in the function <tt>vector_prepend</tt> (starting on line 127 of <tt>vector.c</tt>).
    It is probably easiest to start by studying what <tt>vector_append</tt> does, and following the same general implementation pattern.
    Verify that your implementation is correct by running the <tt>vector</tt> program and analysing the output produced by the <tt>test_prepend</tt> function.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fill in the function <tt>vector_insert</tt> (starting on line 153 of <tt>vector.c</tt>).
    You can get inspiration from the <tt>vector_prepend</tt> function that you just implemented.
    Again, verify that your implementation is correct by analysing the unit test output produced by running the <tt>vector</tt> program.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fill in the <tt>vector_remove</tt> function (starting on line 183 of <tt>vector.c</tt>).
    By now you should have the hang of this kind of test-driven implementation approach, using repeated runs of the unit tests to find out when you're done.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Optional (advanced)</em><br/>
    The <tt>vector_grow</tt> utility function can be improved by using <tt>realloc</tt> instead of <tt>malloc</tt>.
    Read the <tt>realloc(3)</tt> manual page (either by typing "<tt>man realloc</tt>" into the terminal or looking at the <a href="http://www.linuxmanpages.com/man3/realloc.3.php">online version</a>) to find out how it works.
    Then, modify the <tt>vector_grow</tt> code to take advantage of it (you won't need <tt>memcpy</tt> anymore).
  </li>
</ol>



<h2>exercise 3.x: a vector-based stack</h2>

<p>
The source file <a href="itads2012/ex3/stack.c"><tt>stack.c</tt></a> is a partial implementation of a program that prints the lines of a given file in reverse order.
The idea is simple: push all the lines onto a stack, then pop and print until the stack is empty.
Three of the required stack operations have not been implemented yet, but the source code contains instructions and hints.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Implement the function <tt>stack_grow</tt> (line 74).
  </li>
  <li>
    Implement the function <tt>stack_push</tt> (line 98).
  </li>
  <li>
    Implement the function <tt>stack_pop</tt> (line 121).
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
Test your implementation by passing a text file, for example the source code itself, to the program, such as:
</p>

<pre class="command">
./stack stack.c
</pre>
