<h2>exercise 1.1: hello world</h2>

<p>
It is
<a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/H/hello-world.html">traditional</a>
to begin by writing a program that prints "hello, world".  But first
we have to prepare a directory to work in and launch a text editor
with the appropriate filename.
</p>

<pre class="command">
mkdir -p itads/ex1a
cd itads/ex1a
gedit hello-world.c &amp;
</pre>

<p>
The source code for the <tt>hello-world</tt> application is very
short, type or copy-paste it from here into the <tt>gedit</tt> window:
</p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char ** argv)
{
  printf("hello, world\n");
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
  After saving the file, go back to the terminal window and enter the
  commands to compile and run it:
</p>

<pre class="command">
gcc -o hello-world hello-world.c
./hello-world
</pre>

<p>
This example illustrates several fundamental aspects of developing with C under UNIX:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The <tt>gcc</tt> program <em>compiles</em> the source code into a
    binary form which is ready for execution. There are many options
    available that influence what <tt>gcc</tt> does. In this case
    "<tt>-o hello-world</tt>" tells it to save the result of the
    compilation in a file called <tt>hello-world</tt> (notice that
    there is not suffix) and "<tt>hello-world.c</tt>" specifies the
    name of the source file. In case of problems in the source
    file, <tt>gcc</tt> will print error messages.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <tt>hello-world</tt> application is launched by entering
    "<tt>./hello-world</tt>" in the terminal. In fact, the
    "<tt>./</tt>" simply tells the shell that the application is to be
    found in the current working directory. There is no fundamental
    difference between the <tt>hello-world</tt> application and ---
    for example --- <tt>gcc</tt> or <tt>gedit</tt>, except that you
    can launch those by name (without the <tt>./</tt>) because the
    shell will automatically look for applications in a
    customizable <em>search path</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Look at the <a href="hello-world.c">annotated version</a> of the
source code for more information about each line. Then do the
following:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Modify the <tt>hello-world</tt> program so that it prints some
    other message instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    What happens when you erase the return statement from the source
    code and run <tt>gcc</tt> again? Put the statement back before
    continuing with this exercise...
  </li>
  <li>
    What happens if you erase the semicolon (the ; character) and
    re-run <tt>gcc</tt>? Try to understand the compiler messages, and
    put the semicolon back before continuing with the next task...
  </li>
  <li>
    What happens when you change "<tt>main</tt>" to something else,
    for example "<tt>blah</tt>"? Can you still compile the
    application? Try to explain the message you get.
  </li>
</ol>



<h2>exercise 1.2: type conversions</h2>

<p>
Create a file called <tt>type-conversion</tt> and copy the following C source into it:
</p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
#include <stdio.h>

int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
  int x, y;
  double q;
  
  x = 6;
  y = 10;
  q = x / y;
  printf ("x/y is %f\n", q);
  
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
Compile and run the <tt>type-conversion</tt> application by modifying
the command that you used for <tt>hello-world</tt>. The result is
probably not what you expected. Try to explain why before reading on...
</p>

<p>
<b>Answer:</b> in an assignment the expression to the right is
evaluated first, in this case a division. In the division both
arguments are integers so <tt>/</tt> is interpreted as integer
division, the result is then converted into the type of the variable
being assigned, in this case a double-precision floating point.
</p>

<p>
It is possible for the programmer to force type conversion by
preceding the expression to be converted by the type name in
parenthesis, such as "<tt>(double)</tt>". <b>Try it out!</b>
Experiment with the program so that the result stored
in the variable <tt>q</tt> is 0.6 instead of 0.0.
</p>
