<h1>exercise session 1(a):<br/>
<em>types, variables, operators, control flow</em></h1>

<h2>exercise 1.1: hello world</h2>

<p>
It is
<a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/H/hello-world.html">traditional</a>
to begin by writing a program that prints "hello, world".  But first
we have to prepare a directory to work in and launch a text editor
with the appropriate filename.
</p>

<pre class="command">
mkdir -p itads/ex1a
cd itads/ex1a
gedit hello-world.c &amp;
</pre>

<p>
The source code for the <tt>hello-world</tt> application is very
short, type or copy-paste it from here into the <tt>gedit</tt> window:
</p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char ** argv)
{
  printf("hello, world\n");
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
  After saving the file, go back to the terminal window and enter the
  commands to compile and run it:
</p>

<pre class="command">
gcc -o hello-world hello-world.c
./hello-world
</pre>

<p>
This example illustrates several fundamental aspects of developing with C under UNIX:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The <tt>gcc</tt> program <em>compiles</em> the source code into a
    binary form which is ready for execution. There are many options
    available that influence what <tt>gcc</tt> does. In this case
    "<tt>-o hello-world</tt>" tells it to save the result of the
    compilation in a file called <tt>hello-world</tt> (notice that
    there is not suffix) and "<tt>hello-world.c</tt>" specifies the
    name of the source file. In case of problems in the source
    file, <tt>gcc</tt> will print error messages.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <tt>hello-world</tt> application is launched by entering
    "<tt>./hello-world</tt>" in the terminal. In fact, the
    "<tt>./</tt>" simply tells the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29">shell</a> that the application is to be
    found in the current working directory. There is no fundamental
    difference between the <tt>hello-world</tt> application and ---
    for example --- <tt>gcc</tt> or <tt>gedit</tt>, except that you
    can launch those by name (without the <tt>./</tt>) because the
    shell will automatically look for applications in a
    customizable <em>search path</em>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Look at the <a href="hello-world.c">annotated version</a> of the
source code for more information about each line. Then do the
following:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Modify the <tt>hello-world</tt> program so that it prints some
    other message instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    What happens when you erase the return statement from the source
    code and run <tt>gcc</tt> again? Put the statement back before
    continuing with this exercise...
  </li>
  <li>
    What happens if you erase the semicolon (the ; character) and
    re-run <tt>gcc</tt>? Try to understand the compiler messages, and
    put the semicolon back before continuing with the next task...
  </li>
  <li>
    What happens when you change "<tt>main</tt>" to something else,
    for example "<tt>blah</tt>"? Can you still compile the
    application? Try to explain the message you get.
  </li>
</ol>



<h2>exercise 1.2: builtin types</h2>

<p>
Read the source file <a href="builtin-types.c">builtin-types.c</a>
which explains some fundamentals about builtin variable types and how
to print values stored in various formats.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Try to predict what the <tt>builtin-types</tt> application prints
    when you run it. Then compile and run it, to check your
    prediction. <em>(Hint: modify the command that you used for
    compiling and the running <tt>hello-world</tt> application. In the
    terminal, you can use the arrow-up key to reuse old commands, and
    edit them using the arrow and delete/backspace keys.)</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    The variable <tt>cc</tt> gets initialized using a single-character
    constant <tt>'Q'</tt>. What happens when you initialize it with an
    integer constant instead? Try it out by setting <tt>cc =
    81</tt>. Read the manual page about <a href="http://www.linuxmanpages.com/man7/ascii.7.php">ASCII</a> codes (also available in the terminal by giving the command
    "<tt>man ascii</tt>") and find out what number
    you have to use in order to get the letter <tt>'z'</tt>. Check
    your answer by modifying and running the <tt>builtin-types</tt>
    application.
  </li>
  <li>
    What is the largest value that can be stored in a variable of
    type <tt>int</tt>, assuming that it is represented with 4 bytes
    (32 bits)? What happens when you try to initialize an <tt>int</tt>
    variable with a value that is larger than that? Try it out by
    modifying the <tt>builtin-types.c</tt> source code and
    recompiling. How about using an <tt>unsigned int</tt> instead,
    does that influence the largest value that can be stored? How
    about the smallest value for <tt>int</tt> and <tt>unsigned
    int</tt>?
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
The various types can store values of differing ranges. When an
expression involves more than one type, the C compiler tries to
automatically convert everything to the type that has the largest
range. However, this does not always result in something that the
programmer intended. To understand this, create a file
called <tt>type-conversion</tt> and copy the following C source into
it:
</p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
#include <stdio.h>

int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
  int x, y;
  double q;
  
  x = 6;
  y = 10;
  q = x / y;
  printf ("x/y is %f\n", q);
  
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
Compile and run the <tt>type-conversion</tt> application. The result
is probably not what you expected. Try to explain why before reading
on...
</p>

<p>
<b>Answer:</b> in an assignment the expression to the right is
evaluated first, in this case a division. In the division both
arguments are integers so <tt>/</tt> is interpreted as integer
division, the result is then converted into the type of the variable
being assigned, in this case a double-precision floating point.
</p>

<p>
It is possible for the programmer to force type conversion by
preceding the expression to be converted by the type name in
parenthesis, such as "<tt>(double)</tt>". <b>Try it out!</b>
Experiment with the program so that the result stored
in the variable <tt>q</tt> is 0.6 instead of 0.0.
</p>



<h2>exercise 1.3: operators and control flow</h2>

<p>
Assume we have three integer variables called <tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt>,
and <tt>c</tt>, with initial values <tt>b=5</tt>
and <tt>c=8</tt>. What is the value of a, b, and c after each line of
the following program fragment? First find the answer by hand, then
write a program to verify your reply.
</p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
a = b++ + c++;
a = b++ + ++c;
a = ++b + c++;
a = ++b + ++c;
</pre>

<p>
What is the result of the following expression? Write a program to
verify your answer. <em>(Hint: place the expression into
an <tt>if-else</tt> construct which prints different messages
depending on the result of the expression.)</em>
</p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
1 &amp;&amp; 0 || 1
</pre>

<p>
The following program is called <tt>nested-loops</tt>. It prints a
list of all pairs <em>(i,j)</em> such that <em>0 &lt; i &lt; 6</em>
and <em>0 &lt; j &lt; 6</em>.
</p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
#include <stdio.h>

int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
  int ii, jj;

  for (ii = 1; ii <= 5; ii++) {
    for (jj = 1; jj <= 5; jj++) {
      printf ("(%d, %d)\n", ii, jj);
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
</pre>

<ol>
  <li>
    Modify the program so that the pairs are such
    that <em>0 &lt; j &lt;= i &lt; 6</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Modify the program so that a line is printed before each new value
    of <em>i</em>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
The <tt>any-base.c</tt> program shown below implements one method of
representing a number in
any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation">positional
notation</a> system. It also illustrates a few other things:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    C allows to declare and initialize variables in one line, which is
    sometimes convenient.
  </li>
  <li>
    The printf function allows to specify a minimum field width by
    placing a digit between the `<tt>%</tt>' and the number format
    specifier. For example, `<tt>%4d</tt>' results in an integer than
    at least 4 digits are used. If the integer is smaller than
    required, blank spaces are used to pad the field.
  </li>
  <li>
    The `<tt>%</tt>' operator <em>(not to be confused with the same
    character when used inside a format string for the printf
    function)</em> computes
    the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remainder">remainder</a>
    of an integer division.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_assignment">Compound
    assignments</a> such as `<tt>factor *= base</tt>' are frequently
    used shorthands, in this example for `<tt>factor = factor *
    base</tt>'.
  </li>
</ul>

<pre class="sourcecode">
#include <stdio.h>

int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
  unsigned short number = 6245;
  unsigned short base = 3;
  unsigned short factor = 1;
  
  printf ("%u is the sum of:\n", number);
  while (number >= base) {
    printf ("  %u * %4u\n", number % base, factor);
    number /= base;
    factor *= base;
  }
  printf ("  %u * %u\n", number, factor);
  
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
What happens when you set <tt>number = -1</tt> and <tt>base = 2</tt>?
How does this compare to <tt>number = 65535</tt> (which is
2<sup>16</sup>-1). Can you explain what you observe?
</p>

<p>
Perform the following tasks, based on what you have learned so far,
possibly with the help
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language">K+R</a>
(chapter 2).
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Write a program that prints out the addition and multiplication
    tables for single-digit numbers. The result should be nicely
    formatted, such as follows:
    <pre class="command">

<h1>exercise session 1(b):<br/>
<em>arrays, pointers, and strings</em></h1>



<h2>exercise 1.4: arrays</h2>

<p>
The <tt>prime.c</tt> program shown below uses an array as a convenient
way to keep track of numbers that are not prime.
</p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAXNUM 100

int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
  char is_prime[MAXNUM - 1];
  int ii, num;
  
  for (ii = 0; ii < MAXNUM - 1; ++ii) {
    is_prime[ii] = 1;
  }
  
  for (num = 2; num <= MAXNUM / 2; ++num) {
    for (ii = num * 2 - 2; ii <= MAXNUM - 2; ii += num) {
      is_prime[ii] = 0;
    }
  }
  
  printf ("prime numbers up to %d:\n ", MAXNUM);
  for (ii = 0; ii < MAXNUM - 1; ++ii) {
    if (is_prime[ii]) {
      printf (" %d", ii + 2);
    }
  }
  printf ("\n");
  
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<ol>
  <li>
    Try to understand how it operates <em>(Hint: it is based on an
      ancient method of finding prime numbers)</em> and verify that it
      prints the correct result by compiling and running it. Can you
      explain why it sometimes adds or removes 1 or 2 to the indices
      and output?
  </li>
  <li>
    Modify the program to produce a histogram the number of integer
    divisors except 1 and itself, for every number from 2 to 20. The
    output of the program should be:
    <pre class="command">
NUMBER OF INTEGER DIVISORS other than 1 or itself:
  2 
  3 
  4 *
  5

 17 
 18 ****
 19 
 20 ****</pre>
  </li>
</ol>



<h2>exercise 1.5: command line arguments</h2>

<p>
We have now covered enough basics to understand the two arguments of
the <tt>main</tt> function that is required for every C program: the
shell (which interprets the commands you type into the terminal) cuts
the command line into tokens that are separated by spaces, uses the
first token to find the program to run, and places all the tokens into
an <b>array of C strings</b>. The size of this array (i.e. the number
of arguments including the name of the program) gets passed
to <tt>main</tt> as its first argument, commonly named <tt>argc</tt>
(for "argument count"), and the pointer to the first element in this
array gets passed as the second argument to <tt>main</tt>, and that is
commonly called <tt>argv</tt> (for "argument vector"). The declaration
of <tt>argv</tt> can look weird at first, because it is a pointer to a
pointer (indicated by <b>two <tt>*</tt> characters</b>), but this is
explained b ythat fact that <tt>argv</tt> is an array (which is
equivalent to a pointer), and the elements of that array are strings
(which is also equivalent to a pointer).
</p>

<p>
<b>Try it out</b> by creating the following simple program which
simply prints the contents of the argument array. It also introduces
the <tt>strlen</tt> function, which is useful in case you need to find
out the length of a string.
</p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
  int ii;
  for (ii = 0; ii < argc; ++ii) {
    size_t len = strlen (argv[ii]);
    printf ("argv[%d] (length %zu):\t`%s'\n", ii, len, argv[ii]);
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<ol>
  <li>
    Copy the above sourcecode into a file called <tt>printargs.c</tt>,
    compile it, and run it. It should produce the following output:
    <pre class="command">
argv[0] (length 11):    `./printargs'</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Run the <tt>printargs</tt> command with some simple parameters:
    <pre class="command">
./printargs some arguments   and some   spaces</pre>
    Explain the resulting output.
  </li>
  <li>
    Try some more complicated looking arguments:
    <pre class="command">
./printargs bravo \\ "" "something with spaces"</pre>
    This illustrates some possibilities for passing all kinds of
    strings as arguments into a C program.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type a command that produces the following output:
    <pre class="command">
argv[0] (length 11):    `./printargs'
argv[1] (length 1):     `&quot;'</pre>
  </li>
</ol>



<h2>exercise 1.6: bubble sort</h2>

<p>
Sorting is one of the most fundamental tasks that programs have to
perform under all kinds of circumstances, and many algorithms have
been developed to sort various kinds of data under different
circumstances. A very simple example
is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort">Bubble Sort</a>
which is based on the idea of repeatedly scanning through the data,
and swapping any two neighboring items that are in the wrong
order. The following code shows how it works in principle, but this is
a quite inefficient implementation. <em>(This code also uses some
convenient C syntax for initializing and sizing static arrays, and a
way to <tt>printf</tt> floating point numbers with a given precision
as well as reserving space for the optionally leading minus
sign.)</em>
</p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
#include <stdio.h>

int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
  int ii, jj, length;
  double data[] = { 351.354, 21.02, -3544.2, 152.999 };
  double tmp;
  
  length = sizeof(data) / sizeof(double);
  
  for (ii = 0; ii < length; ++ii) {
    for (jj = 1; jj < length; ++jj) {
      if (data[jj] < data[jj - 1]) {
	tmp = data[jj];
	data[jj] = data[jj - 1];
	data[jj - 1] = tmp;
      }
    }
  }
  
  for (ii = 0; ii < length; ++ii) {
    printf ("% 8.2f\n", data[ii]);
  }
  
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
Based on this example implementation of bubble-sort and what you've
learned above about command line arguments, write a program
called <tt>args-bubble-sort</tt> that takes each argument string and
sorts it character-by-character. The output of the program should be
(depending on the arguments that you give it):
</p>

<pre class="command">
./args-bubble-sort 743 oiufObIwUWBF

in:  743
out: 347

in:  oiufObIwUWBF
out: BFIOUWbfiouw</pre>
