<h1>ITADS 2011 exercise session 1<br/>
<em>types, variables, operators, control flow</em></h1>

<h2>exercise 1.1: hello world</h2>

<p>
It is
<a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/H/hello-world.html">traditional</a>
to begin by writing a program that prints "hello, world".  But first
we have to prepare a directory to work in and launch a text editor
with the appropriate filename.
</p>

<pre class="command">
mkdir -p itads/ex1
cd itads/ex1
gedit hello-world.c &amp;
</pre>

<p>
The source code for the <tt>hello-world</tt> application is very
short, type or copy-paste it from here into the <tt>gedit</tt> window:
</p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char ** argv)
{
  printf("hello, world\n");
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
  After saving the file, go back to the terminal window and enter the
  commands to compile and run it:
</p>

<pre class="command">
gcc -o hello-world hello-world.c
./hello-world
</pre>

<p>
This example illustrates several fundamental aspects of developing with C under UNIX:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The <tt>gcc</tt> program <em>compiles</em> the source code into a
    binary form which is ready for execution. There are many options
    available that influence what <tt>gcc</tt> does. In this case
    "<tt>-o hello-world</tt>" tells it to save the result of the
    compilation in a file called <tt>hello-world</tt> (notice that
    there is not suffix) and "<tt>hello-world.c</tt>" specifies the
    name of the source file. In case of problems in the source
    file, <tt>gcc</tt> will print error messages.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <tt>hello-world</tt> application is launched by entering
    "<tt>./hello-world</tt>" in the terminal. In fact, the
    "<tt>./</tt>" simply tells the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29">shell</a> that the application is to be
    found in the current working directory. There is no fundamental
    difference between the <tt>hello-world</tt> application and ---
    for example --- <tt>gcc</tt> or <tt>gedit</tt>, except that you
    can launch those by name (without the <tt>./</tt>) because the
    shell will automatically look for applications in a
    customizable <em>search path</em>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Look at the <a href="itads2012/ex1/hello-world.c">annotated version</a> of the
source code for more information about each line. Then do the
following:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Modify the <tt>hello-world</tt> program so that it prints some
    other message instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    What happens when you erase the return statement from the source
    code and run <tt>gcc</tt> again? Put the statement back before
    continuing with this exercise...
  </li>
  <li>
    What happens if you erase the semicolon (the ; character) and
    re-run <tt>gcc</tt>? Try to understand the compiler messages, and
    put the semicolon back before continuing with the next task...
  </li>
  <li>
    What happens when you change "<tt>main</tt>" to something else,
    for example "<tt>blah</tt>"? Can you still compile the
    application? Try to explain the message you get.
  </li>
</ol>



<h2>exercise 1.2: builtin types</h2>

<p>
Read the source file <a href="itads2012/ex1/builtin-types.c">builtin-types.c</a>
which explains some fundamentals about builtin variable types and how
to print values stored in various formats.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Try to predict what the <tt>builtin-types</tt> application prints
    when you run it. Then compile and run it, to check your
    prediction. <em>(Hint: modify the command that you used for
    compiling and the running <tt>hello-world</tt> application. In the
    terminal, you can use the arrow-up key to reuse old commands, and
    edit them using the arrow and delete/backspace keys.)</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    The variable <tt>cc</tt> gets initialized using a single-character
    constant <tt>'Q'</tt>. What happens when you initialize it with an
    integer constant instead? Try it out by setting <tt>cc =
    81</tt>. Read the manual page about <a href="http://www.linuxmanpages.com/man7/ascii.7.php">ASCII</a> codes (also available in the terminal by giving the command
    "<tt>man ascii</tt>") and find out what number
    you have to use in order to get the letter <tt>'z'</tt>. Check
    your answer by modifying and running the <tt>builtin-types</tt>
    application.
  </li>
  <li>
    What is the largest value that can be stored in a variable of
    type <tt>int</tt>, assuming that it is represented with 4 bytes
    (32 bits)? What happens when you try to initialize an <tt>int</tt>
    variable with a value that is larger than that? Try it out by
    modifying the <tt>builtin-types.c</tt> source code and
    recompiling. How about using an <tt>unsigned int</tt> instead,
    does that influence the largest value that can be stored? How
    about the smallest value for <tt>int</tt> and <tt>unsigned
    int</tt>?
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
The various types can store values of differing ranges. When an
expression involves more than one type, the C compiler tries to
automatically convert everything to the type that has the largest
range. However, this does not always result in something that the
programmer intended. To understand this, create a file
called <tt>type-conversion</tt> and copy the following C source into
it:
</p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
  int x, y;
  double q;
  
  x = 6;
  y = 10;
  q = x / y;
  printf ("x/y is %f\n", q);
  
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
Compile and run the <tt>type-conversion</tt> application. The result
is probably not what you expected. Try to explain why before reading
on...
</p>

<p>
<b>Answer:</b> in an assignment the expression to the right is
evaluated first, in this case a division. In the division both
arguments are integers so <tt>/</tt> is interpreted as integer
division, the result is then converted into the type of the variable
being assigned, in this case a double-precision floating point.
</p>

<p>
It is possible for the programmer to force type conversion by
preceding the expression to be converted by the type name in
parenthesis, such as "<tt>(double)</tt>". <b>Try it out!</b>
Experiment with the program so that the result stored
in the variable <tt>q</tt> is 0.6 instead of 0.0.
</p>



<h2>exercise 1.3: operators and control flow</h2>

<p>
Assume we have three integer variables called <tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt>,
and <tt>c</tt>, with initial values <tt>b=5</tt>
and <tt>c=8</tt>. What is the value of a, b, and c after each line of
the following program fragment? First find the answer by hand, then
write a program to verify your reply.
</p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
a = b++ + c++;
a = b++ + ++c;
a = ++b + c++;
a = ++b + ++c;
</pre>

<p>
What is the result of the following expression? Write a program to
verify your answer. <em>(Hint: place the expression into
an <tt>if-else</tt> construct which prints different messages
depending on the result of the expression.)</em>
</p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
1 &amp;&amp; 0 || 1
</pre>

<p>
The following program is called <tt>nested-loops</tt>. It prints a
list of all pairs <em>(i,j)</em> such that <em>0 &lt; i &lt; 6</em>
and <em>0 &lt; j &lt; 6</em>.
</p>

<pre class="sourcecode">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
  int ii, jj;

  for (ii = 1; ii <= 5; ii++) {
    for (jj = 1; jj <= 5; jj++) {
      printf ("(%d, %d)\n", ii, jj);
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
</pre>

<ol>
  <li>
    Modify the program so that the pairs are such
    that <em>0 &lt; j &lt;= i &lt; 6</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Modify the program so that a line is printed before each new value
    of <em>i</em>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
The <tt>any-base.c</tt> program shown below implements one method of
representing a number in
any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation">positional
notation</a> system. It also illustrates a few other things:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    C allows to declare and initialize variables in one line, which is
    sometimes convenient.
  </li>
  <li>
    The printf function allows to specify a minimum field width by
    placing a digit between the `<tt>%</tt>' and the number format
    specifier. For example, `<tt>%4d</tt>' results in an integer than
    at least 4 digits are used. If the integer is smaller than
    required, blank spaces are used to pad the field.
  </li>
  <li>
    The `<tt>%</tt>' operator <em>(not to be confused with the same
    character when used inside a format string for the printf
    function)</em> computes
    the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remainder">remainder</a>
    of an integer division.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_assignment">Compound
    assignments</a> such as `<tt>factor *= base</tt>' are frequently
    used shorthands, in this example for `<tt>factor = factor *
    base</tt>'.
  </li>
</ul>

<pre class="sourcecode">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main (int argc, char ** argv)
{
  unsigned short number = 6245;
  unsigned short base = 3;
  unsigned short factor = 1;
  
  printf ("%u is the sum of:\n", number);
  while (number >= base) {
    printf ("  %u * %4u\n", number % base, factor);
    number /= base;
    factor *= base;
  }
  printf ("  %u * %u\n", number, factor);
  
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
What happens when you set <tt>number = -1</tt> and <tt>base = 2</tt>?
How does this compare to <tt>number = 65535</tt> (which is
2<sup>16</sup>-1). Can you explain what you observe?
</p>

<p>
Perform the following tasks, based on what you have learned so far,
possibly with the help
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language">[K+R]</a>
chapter 2.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Write a program that prints out the addition and multiplication
    tables for single-digit numbers. The result should be nicely
    formatted, such as follows:
