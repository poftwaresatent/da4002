<h1>ITADS Exercise 2: Sequence Containers</h1>

<p>
It is recommended that you create a new directory for this
exercise. Also, here is a
little <a href="itads/exercise2/Makefile">Makefile</a> that you can
place into that directory. The Makefile allows you to simply launch
<a href="http://linuxmanpages.com/man1/make.1.php">make</a> in the
terminal, and that will figure out which java sources need to be
recompiled into binaries. <em>(This only works on Linux, but Windows
users probably are using Eclipse anyway, which also takes care of
compiling the correct sources.)</em>
</p>

<p>
Also note that now each .java file contains one class, and that the
file name (without the .java extension) is exactly the same as the
class it contains. This is a naming convention which allows Java to
find classes across different files and helps developers to keep their
project directories more organized.
</p>



<h2>exercise 2.1: vectors (resizeable arrays)</h2>

<p>
<a href="itads/exercise2/StringVector.java">StringVector.java</a> is
an empty shell for implementing a dynamically expanding array of
strings.  Implement each of the undefined methods and check your work
regularly by executing the provided main function.  You can of course
extend the main function as needed for testing more things
</p>



<h2>exercise 2.2: a simple stack machine</h2>

<p>
The StringVector from the previous exercise can be used like a
stack. As an illustration of this
behavior, <a href="itads/exercise2/RPNCalculator.java">RPNCalculator.java</a>
uses a StringVector as stack for implementing
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_Notation">Reverse
Polish Notation</a> (RPN) calculator. Such a calculator is an example
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine">stack
machine</a>, a simple yet powerful computing technique.
</p>

<p>
The way it works is that you enter <em>operands</em> (numbers) one per
line, and each one gets pushed onto a stack. Then you enter an
<em>operation</em> code, such as <b>+</b> to perform an addition. When
an operation is encountered, the corresponding operands are popped off the stack, the operation is performed on them, and the result is pushed onto the stack.
</p>

<p>
Thus, in order to compute 1+2, you have to enter 1 (return), 2
(return), and + (return). Try it out by compiling and launching
RPNCalculator. At the beginning, the RPNCalculator only supports
additions and substractions. It does not even support a "quit"
command, so you have to press Control-C to exit from it.
</p>

<ol>
 <li>
  Locate the code which reads the input lines and feeds it to the RPN processing routine.
 </li>
 <li>
  Locate the code which performs operations (additions and substractions).
 </li>
 <li>
  Change the RPN processing routine such that you can also multiply
  and divide with the calculator.
 </li>
 <li>
  Change the processing routine to add the following commands:
  <ul>
   <li><b>h</b> - print a help message listing all available operations</li>
   <li><b>c</b> - clear the stack</li>
   <li><b>s</b> - sum up all the numbers on the stack (and place the result back on the stack)</li>
   <li><b>q</b> - quit the application</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ol>



<h2>exercise 2.3: linked lists</h2>

<p>
<a href="itads/exercise2/StringList.java">StringList.java</a> is a
functioning implementation of a simply linked list of
strings <em>(some of the methods are not yet implemented and some more
fields and methods are commented-out for now)</em>.  It
needs <a href="itads/exercise2/StringListNode.java">StringListNode.java</a>
to store the data along with the pointer to the next element, and it
uses <a href="itads/exercise2/StringListIterator.java">StringListIterator.java</a>
to make it easier for client code to iterate over all elements.
</p>

<ol>
 <li>
  Implement the <tt>insert</tt> method to support insertion at
  (immediately following) any location (except the front).
 </li>
 <li>
   In order to split a random sequence of "o" and "*" such that all
   "o" are in one block at the beginning of a list, and all "*" are in
   a block after that, all that needs to be done is to insert items
   always into the boundary between the already existing
   blocks. <a href="itads/exercise2/SplitSequence.java">SplitSequence.java</a>
   is an almost-finished program to illustrate that simple and
   effective algorithm. Locate the comment which tells you where to
   add code, and do the necessary changes so that program correctly
   clusters the "o" and the "*" into two blocks.
 </li>
</ol>


<h2>exercise 2.4 <em>(optional)</em>: detecting cycles in simply linked lists</h2>

<dl>
 <dt>Note</dt>
 <dd>This is exercise 17.4 from the course book</dd>
</dl>

<p>
A linked list contains a cycle if, starting from some node <em>p</em>,
following a sufficient number of <em>next</em> links brings us back to
node <em>p</em>. Node <em>p</em> does not have to be the first node in
the list. Assume that you are given a linked list with an unknown
number of nodes. Design an algorithm to determine whether the list
contains a cycle:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    You may use extra space proportional to the number of nodes in the
    list.
  </li>
  <li>
    Now find a better algorithm which requires only very little extra
    space, and the amount of extra space is independent of the number
    of nodes in the list. <em>(Hint: Use two iterators that are
      initially at the start of the list, but advance at different
      speeds.)</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Implement your algorithm: use the
    half-finished <a href="itads/exercise2/DetectCycle.java">DetectCycle.java</a>
    which contains a test fixture (some code that will call your
    function and tell you whether it works or not).
  </li>
</ol>



<h2>exercise 2.5: doubly linked list</h2>

<p>
In StringList.java (after you've done exercise 2.3), un-comment the
fields and methods that relate to doubly linked
lists: <tt>tail</tt>, <tt>pushBack</tt>, <tt>popBack</tt>,
and <tt>back</tt>. Implement the methods such that the StringList is
now doubly linked. This will also require changes to most of the
existing methods. Check your work by extending the <tt>main</tt>
method with new tests.
</p>



<h2>exercise 2.7 <em>(optional)</em>: using generics to support any data type</h2>

<p>
The vector and list data structures used in the exercises above are
all hard-coded to work with strings. This makes them hard to reuse in
practice, because you would have to copy-paste-edit them for each new
type of value that you want to store. Instead, it is much better to
define these data structures using Java generics.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Save StringList.java as List.java and change it so that it
    supports any type. You can use the
    generic <a href="itads/exercise2/ListNode.java">ListNode.java</a>
    and <a href="itads/exercise2/ListIterator.java">ListIterator.java</a>
    as a starting point, which show you how to make the two necessary
    ingredients generic. Test your generic list by changing
    the <tt>main</tt> function to use something other than strings.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do the same with StringVector.java: rename it to Vector.java and
    do the necessary changes. <b>Note</b> that Java does not allow to
    create arrays of generics, but you can use a workaround that
    involves an unchecked type case. Instead of
    <pre>array = new AnyType [initialCapacity]</pre>
    you can write
    <pre>array = (AnyType[]) new Object [initialCapacity]</pre>
    The Java compiler will issue a warning, but in this case it can
    safely be ignored.
  </li>
</ol>
