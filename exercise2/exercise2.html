<h1>ITADS Exercise 2: Sequence Containers</h1>



<h2>exercise 2.1: vectors (resizeable arrays)</h2>

<p>
<a href="itads/exercise2/StringVector.java">StringVector.java</a> is an empty shell for implementing a dynamically expanding array of strings.  Implement each of the undefined methods and check your work regularly by executing the provided main function.  You can of course extend the main function as needed for testing more things
</p>



<h2>exercise 2.3: linked lists</h2>

<p>
<a href="itads/exercise2/StringList.java">StringList.java</a> is a functioning implementation of a simply linked list of strings <em>(some of the methods are not yet implemented and some fields are still commented-out)</em>.  It needs <a href="itads/exercise2/StringListNode.java">StringListNode.java</a> to store the data along with the pointer to the next element, and it uses <a href="itads/exercise2/StringListIterator.java">StringListIterator.java</a> to make it easier for client code to iterate over all elements.
</p>

<ol>
 <li>
  Implement the method <tt>insertAfter</tt> to support insertion at any location (except the front).
 </li>
 <li>
  Write a ...
 </li>
</ol>



<h2>exercise 2.4: linked list iteration</h2>



<h2>exercise 2.8: sorting gnomes</h2>

<p>
With an iterator which does or doesn't get advanced based on the gnome that last joined the row.
</p>



<h2>exercise 2.5: doubly linked list</h2>

<p>
Simple extension of simply linked list.
</p>



<h2>exercise 2.6: doubly linked list iteration</h2>



<h2>exercise 2.7: using inheritance to support any data type</h2>

<p>
Use a cast...
</p>



<h2>exercise 2.9: sequence container interfaces</h2>



<h2>exercise 2.10: stacks</h2>

<h2>exercise 2.11: queues</h2>

<h2>exercise XXX (extra): using generics to support any data type</h2>
